It contains designer Tim Schafer‘s vision of the entire game before any of it was built, which is remarkably consistent with what was eventually put together.
It includes a significant amount of cut content — characters, locations, and backstory that never made it into the final game. There’s also quite a bit of concept art, although much of this is in Grim Fandango Remastered.
Virtually all of the information contained within the Puzzle Document is being integrated into the ‘behind the scenes’ sections of our character and location pages.

Eighty participants were assigned to play a violent video game cooperatively or competitively with a confederate posing as an outgroup or ingroup member. The main findings corroborate previous research on the beneficial effects of cooperative game play and suggest playing cooperatively can increase helping behavior. Furthermore, cooperation with an outgroup member can actually reduce aggression. Implications of findings for future research are discussed.},

However, investigating AR concepts outdoors, especially on-the-move, has proven to be a challenging task. Although previous work has examined use cases for using AR for everyday activities in urban environments, most of the contexts explored with people being on-the-move outdoors are in a conceptual stage and these contexts mainly regard AR from a utilitarian perspective. This thesis’ goal is to design and evaluate meaningful AR concepts that intend to assist people while on-the-move in a context sensitive and personalized manner, hoping to empower them by leveraging new forms of interaction while merging the virtual and physical world. I aim to contribute an overview of the design space for AR, while people are on-the-move, provide insights for meaningful AR visualizations, and establish design guidelines for such concepts.},

The IADS-2 is a standardized database of 167 naturally occurring sounds that is widely used in the study of emotions. The sounds were rated by 300 college students who were native speakers of EP, in the three affective dimensions of valence, arousal, and dominance, by using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). The aims of this adaptation were threefold: (1) to provide researchers with standardized and normatively rated affective sounds to be used with an EP population; (2) to investigate sex and cultural differences in the ratings of affective dimensions of auditory stimuli between EP and the American (Bradley \& Lang, 2007a) and Spanish (Fernández-Abascal et al., Psicothema 20:104-113 2008; Redondo, Fraga, Padrón, \& Piñeiro, Behavior Research Methods 40:784-790 2008) standardizations; and (3) to promote research on auditory affective processing in Portugal. Our results indicated that the IADS-2 is a valid and useful database of digitized sounds for the study of emotions in a Portuguese context, allowing for comparisons of its results with those of other international studies that have used the same database for stimulus selection. The normative values of the EP adaptation of the IADS-2 database can be downloaded along with the online version of this article.},

Asymmetric games feature different rules, abilities, or objectives for different players, generating unique and nuanced game experiences. Multiplayer asymmetric games in particular have been shown to increase teamwork and a collaborative mindset even after a play session has ended. Asymmetric design is commonplace in both digital and analog games but has yet to see widespread adoption in the emerging Virtual Reality (VR) gaming space. BirdQuestVR seeks to leverage the affordances of current consumer-grade VR headsets to build asymmetric gameplay around communication, embodied performance, and physical humour.},

	abstract = {Cooperative design has been an integral part of many games. With the success of games like Left4Dead, many game designers and producers are currently exploring the addition of cooperative patterns within their games. Unfortunately, very little research investigated cooperative patterns or methods to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a set of cooperative patterns identified based on analysis of fourteen cooperative games. Additionally, we propose Cooperative Performance Metrics (CPM). To evaluate the use of these CPMs, we ran a study with a total of 60 participants, grouped in 2-3 participants per session. Participants were asked to play four cooperative games (Rock Band 2, Lego Star Wars, Kameo, and Little Big Planet). Videos of the play sessions were annotated using the CPMs, which were then mapped to cooperative patterns that caused them. Results, validated through inter-rater agreement, identify several effective cooperative patterns and lessons for future cooperative game designs.},

Zunächst werden zentrale Begriffe wie Kommunikation und Interaktion erläutert. In einem zweiten Schritt geht es um einfache Kommunikationsmodelle und komplexere Theorien interpersonaler Kommunikation wie z. B. die Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns. Dabei werden auch Realitätskonstruktionen und deren Wirkung diskutiert. Im dritten Schritt werden zentrale Fragen der Massenkommunikation geklärt. Nach grundlegenden Überlegungen und einer Definition des Medienbegriffs werden drei Perspektiven auf Massenkommunikation eröffnet: Aus der Kommunikatorperspektive werden Modelle der Nachrichtenauswahl und Nachrichtenstrukturierung diskutiert. Aus der Perspektive von Mediennutzung und Medienrezeption werden sowohl theoretische Modelle als auch praktische und ökonomische Aspekte angewandter Mediaforschung vorgestellt. Aus der Wirkungsperspektive werden schließlich die wichtigsten Ansätze zu verschiedenen Arten von Medienwirkungen erörtert.},

	abstract = {Background Both negative and positive associations between social networking service (SNS) usage and mental health have been suggested by previous studies; however, their differences by type of SNS and age remain unclear. We addressed this issue based on the frequency of traditional communication such as face-to-face and non-face-to-face communication (e.g., phone, email, and letters). Methods In total, 8,576 individuals participated, including 2,543 aged 18–39, 3,048 aged 40–64, and 2,985 aged over 65 years. They were asked to indicate their frequency of SNS usage, both for posting and checking, of LINE (a popular message application in Japan), Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, with frequent usage defined as posting or checking more than a few times a week. To determine mental health status, WHO-5 (i.e., well-being), K6 (i.e., distress symptoms), and feelings of loneliness were assessed. Multiple and logistic regression analyses were adjusted for the frequency of traditional communication. To avoid type 1 error, a Bonferroni correction of p ≤ 0.002 was applied in the regression models (p = 0.05/18, a number of regression models). Results The most frequently used SNS across the three age groups was LINE; frequent usage (both posting and checking) among older adults was independently associated with better well-being. Frequent posting on Facebook was associated with better well-being in middle-aged adults. Young adults who frequently checked on Instagram showed a tendency toward better well-being and lower distress symptoms. On the contrary, frequent usage of Twitter was associated with distress symptoms or feelings of loneliness across all three age groups. Conclusions We found generational and SNS-type-dependent negative and positive associations between SNS use and mental health, indicating the possible influences of SNS use and the importance of non-SNS communication.},

We believe that augmented reality is a natural interface to visualize spacial information such as position or direction of locations and objects for location based applications that process and present information based on the user's position in the real world. To enable such applications we construct an indoor tracking system that covers a substantial part of a building. It is based on visual tracking of fiducial markers enhanced with an inertial sensor for fast rotational updates. To scale such a system to a whole building we introduce a space partitioning scheme to reuse fiducial markers throughout the environment. Finally we demonstrate two location based applications built upon this facility, an indoor navigation aid and a library search application.},

Es findet ein Vergleich zwischen der Touchscreen Applikation „Fatmap“1 (FATMAP {\textbar} Discover a world of adventure..., o. J.) und einem auf der Basis mobiler Augmented Reality entwickelten Prototypen statt. Um die Usability zu untersuchen, wurden Evaluationen zur Messung der Faktoren Effektivität, Effizienz und Zufriedenheit durchgeführt. Auf Grundlage der Ergebnisse wurde zudem ein Vorbereitungstool für eine alpine Skitour entwickelt. Für den Versuchsaufbau wurde zu Beginn die prototypische mobile AR-Applikation dem UX-Design Prozess folgend aufgesetzt. In dieser Phase fand eine tiefgreifende Recherche zu den Themen Orientierung, Interaktion und Skitouren statt, woraus die Anforderungen und das Konzept für den Prototyp abgeleitet wurden. Dieser wurde mit Hilfe einer Online-Plattform umgesetzt und auf einem iPad evaluiert. Das Testdesign beinhaltet Fragebögen zur wahrgenommenen User Experience, einen Usability Test zur Messung der Effizienz und einen Usability Test zur Messung der Effektivität. Insgesamt wurden 17 Proband: innen mit beiden Applikationen evaluiert, die gemessenen Faktoren ausgewertet und interpretiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass es Unterschiede bei der Effizienz und der Zufriedenheit der Anwendungen gibt, aber auch die Effektivität wird kontrovers diskutiert. Die Erkenntnisse bestätigen Vorteile bei der Interaktion mit dem AR-Prototypen, lassen jedoch offen, ob sich Nachteile der Effektivität durch technische Verbesserungen eliminieren lassen. In jedem Fall wurde die AR-Anwendung als spannender und origineller wahrgenommen, was zu einer höheren Motivation führt.},

We address the multidimensional nature of engagement, encompassing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects across various gaming domains. We present a taxonomy of the diverse modalities for quantifying engagement, including physiological signals, observable behaviors, and gameplay data. We identify the challenges of conducting representative subjective studies in this domain and summarize various methods for establishing ground truth measurements. By synthesizing existing research, we provide insights into modeling techniques, highlight research gaps, and offer practical guidelines for implementing engagement measurement strategies. This review aims to aid researchers and industry professionals in navigating the complexities of player engagement estimation, ultimately contributing to enhanced game design, marketing, and user retention in the competitive gaming landscape.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of young adults, and video gaming has emerged as a popular coping mechanism. However, excessive gaming could have negative consequences. The purpose of the study was to understand the relationship between video gaming and the mental health of young adults, globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the relationship between video gaming and the mental health of young adults during the pandemic. The study followed PRISMA 2020 and conducted a comprehensive literature search in multiple databases: PubMed Central (PMC), Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We found 11 relevant articles published between March 2020 and March 2023, predominantly using online questionnaires and focused on young adults, mostly college students. The findings showed that video gaming had both positive and negative influences on psychological well-being. It served as a coping mechanism for young adults dealing with stress and isolation, providing a sense of belongingness. However, excessive gaming disrupted social interaction and family relationships. Regular gamers were found to adapt better to the virtual environment. The findings highlight calls for accessible mental health resources and awareness to maintain healthy gaming behavior.},

Yet, we have limited means to rigorously define or communicate the structures that govern these experiences, hindering attempts at consolidating knowledge and limiting the potential of design efforts. In this work, we introduce the Living Framework for Cooperative Games (LFCG), a framework derived from a multi-step systematic analysis of 129 cooperative games with contributions of eleven researchers. We describe how LFCG can be used as a tool for analyses and ideation, and as a shared language for describing a game’s design. LFCG is published as a web application to facilitate use and appropriation. It supports the creation, dissemination and aggregation of game reports and specifications; and enables stakeholders to extend and publish custom versions. Lastly, we discuss using a research-driven approach for formalising game structures and the advantages of community contributions for consolidation and reach.},

Designing games that cater to these differences remains an open challenge. In this paper, we first identify barriers related with time and expertise. Next, we propose asymmetric game design and asynchronous play to reconcile children's and adults' requirements; and interdependent gameplay mechanics to foster real-world interactions. Following this approach, we designed a testbed game and conducted a mixed-methods remote study with six pairs of adult-child family members. Our results showcase how asymmetric, asynchronous experiences can be leveraged to create novel gaming experiences that meet the requirements of family play. We discuss how interdependent progress can be designed to promote real-world interactions, creating pervasive conversational topics that permeate the family routine.},

Often this requires establishing ad-hoc workgroups that come together to address a new problem over a short period of time. In these cases, it is important that group members can work together effectively in a short amount of time. We are interested in understanding how computer-based "icebreaking" video games can help group members work together in real world collaborations. To do this, we identified icebreaking video game requirements based on the literature and ran an experiment with ad-hoc workgroups within an organization to assess the effect of playing an icebreaking video game before one of their collaborative work tasks. We compared groups that participated in the icebreaking video game prior to the work task with those that did not. We found that groups that played the icebreaking video game demonstrated increased collaboration in the subsequent work task.},

The model presents seven different archetypes of players: Seeker, Survivor, Daredevil, Mastermind, Conqueror, Socialiser, and Achiever. We explain how each of these player archetypes relates to older player typologies (such as Myers-Briggs), and how each archetype characterizes a specific playing style. We conducted a survey among more than 50,000 players using the BrainHex model as a personality type motivator to gather and compare demographic data to the different BrainHex archetypes. We discuss some results from this survey with a focus on psychometric orientation of respondents, to establish relationships between personality types and BrainHex archetypes.},

The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However quite different groupings are possible and this demonstrates the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. An approximately three-dimensional taxonomy is proposed comprising the following dimensions: extent of world knowledge, reproduction fidelity, and extent of presence metaphor.},

Subjects (N = 116) competed in a basketball free-throw shooting game, following which they completed the IMI. The LISREL VI computer program was employed to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to assess the tenability of a five factor hierarchical model representing four first-order factors or dimensions and a second-order general factor representing intrinsic motivation. Indices of model acceptability tentatively suggest that the sport data adequately fit the hypothesized five factor hierarchical model. Alternative models were tested but did not result in significant improvements in the goodness-of-fit indices, suggesting the proposed model to be the most accurate of the models tested. Coefficient alphas for the four dimensions and the overall scale indicated adequate reliability. The results are discussed with regard to the importance of accurate assessment of psychological constructs and the use of linear structural equations in confirming the factor structures of measures.},

	abstract = {Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, social interactions were constrained by physical distancing guidelines. Consequently, some individuals may have turned to video games to cope with isolation and negative emotions. Previous studies have shown that people who struggle with anxiety and depression are at particular risk for developing problem gaming behaviours. However, there is a paucity of longitudinal research testing pathways from negative emotionality to problem gaming behaviours, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we conducted a multi-wave longitudinal study and predicted that high levels of emotional vulnerability (anxiety and depression) in the first month of the pandemic would prospectively relate to elevated time spent gaming and related problems six months later. We also predicted that elevated coping motives for gaming would mediate these associations. A sample of 332 Canadian gamers (Mage = 33.79; 60.8\% men) completed three surveys on Prolific, with the first occurring in April 2020 (one-month after the declared COVID-19 state of emergency) and subsequent surveys were spaced three months apart. High initial levels of emotional vulnerability predicted excessive time spent gaming, as well as related problems, six months into the pandemic. Elevated coping motives for gaming uniquely mediated these pathways. This longitudinal study is the first to show that negative emotionality was a vulnerability factor for coping-related problem gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we continue to cope with the longer-lasting impacts of the pandemic, it will be important for individuals who struggle with mood and anxiety issues to find more effective ways of coping.},

	abstract = {Different Augmented Reality (AR) displays are becoming more commonly used for work since AR promises benefits by offering support, e.g., with additional information or hints. However, most research compares AR with traditional work support, like paper-based or web-based instructions. Since various AR technologies offer device-specific advantages and disadvantages, different AR technologies are more or less suitable to offer support without overwhelming or distracting the worker. Research, therefore, needs to derive empirical results from comparing different AR displays to derive concrete recommendations for action on the use and design of AR for specific contexts. To address this research gap, this experimental study investigates the effect of video-see-through head-mounted AR (Varjo XR-3) vs. handheld AR (Apple iPad) on performance (time and committed failure), motivation, and cognitive load for guided assembly. The study results reveal that both AR displays can successfully guide people in guided assembly tasks. On a descriptive level, the head-mounted AR device reveals slightly better results in terms of time and committed failures. Notably, the impact of technical restrictions on the study results was still evident. Accordingly, further investigation of device-specific differences is of continuing importance.},

	abstract = {Escape rooms exist in various forms, including real-life facilities, board games, and digital implementations. The underlying idea is always the same: players have to solve many diverse puzzles to (virtually) escape from a locked room. Within the last decade, we witnessed a rapidly increasing popularity of such games, which also amplified the amount of related research. However, the respective academic landscape is mostly fragmented in its current state, lacking a common model and vocabulary that would withstand these games' variety. This manuscript aims to establish such a foundation for the analysis and construction of escape rooms. In a first step, we derive a high-level design framework from prior literature. Then, as our main contribution, we establish an atomic puzzle taxonomy that closes the gap between the analog and digital domains. The taxonomy is developed in multiple steps: we compose a basic structure based on previous literature and systematically refine it by analyzing 39 analog and digital escape room games, including recent virtual reality representatives. The final taxonomy consists of mental, physical, and emotional challenges, thereby providing a robust and approachable basis for future works across all application domains that deal with escape rooms or puzzles in general.},

Previous studies have shown that asymmetric virtual reality (VR) games —games that utilize and consider differences of various kinds— can improve users’ social and player experience. However, the impact of existing social factors on users’ experiences is still unknown in asymmetric games. In this paper, we designed and implemented an asymmetric game in which both players are in VR. In the game, players had to exchange asymmetric information to complete tasks, resulting in a strategic interdependence. We studied how familiarity (friends vs. strangers) affects social and player experience, as well as game performance. In our preliminary between-participants study (N=14), we did not find significant differences between the friend and stranger teams in social and player experience, or game performance. We discuss how asymmetries can be used to create social VR games, and how and why familiarity does (not) affect the experience of players.},

We win or lose the game in the real world, but we slay a dragon (for example) only in the world of the game. In this thought-provoking study, Jesper Juul examines the constantly evolving tension between rules and fiction in video games. Discussing games from Pong to The Legend of Zelda, from chess to Grand Theft Auto, he shows how video games are both a departure from and a development of traditional non-electronic games. The book combines perspectives from such fields as literary and film theory, computer science, psychology, economic game theory, and game studies to outline a theory of what video games are, how they work with the player, how they have developed historically, and why they are fun to play." "Locating video games in a history of games that goes back to Ancient Egypt, Juul argues that there is a basic affinity between games and computers. Just as the printing press and the cinema have promoted and enabled new kinds of storytelling, computers work as enablers of games, letting us play old games in new ways and allowing for new kinds of games that would not have been possible before computers. Juul presents a classic game model, which describes the traditional construction of games and points to possible future developments. He examines how rules provide challenges, learning, and enjoyment for players, and how a game cues the player into imagining its fictional world. Juul's lively style and eclectic deployment of sources will make Half-Real of interest to media, literature, and game scholars as well as to game professionals and gamers."--BOOK JACKET; Includes bibliographical references (p.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology, such as augmented reality (AR), has served as the display for building information modeling (BIM)-based architectural design collaboration to provide more effective design observation and communication for stakeholders. That said, AR has several technical limitations in terms of personal device issues, user experience, and visualization quality. A new form of AR called spatial augmented reality (SAR) has been introduced to address these issues, which uses a digital projector to present graphics on physical objects for augmenting real-world objects. Therefore, SAR has great benefits and potentials to combine with BIM for design collaboration. This paper introduces a BIM-based SAR operational framework, where 3D building models generated from BIM software are imported to projection mapping tools to display building surface textures on physical white building models. A case study using Revit and 3ds Max as the BIM software, and MadMapper as the projection mapping tool, was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework and to evaluate the projection performance of SAR. The case study showed that the texture of BIM models could be projected on the objects clearly and realistically. Additionally, the proposed SAR method potentially offers intuitive observation of building models and comfortable wear-free experience for collaborative design, and the qualitative analysis by changing the parameters was conducted to test the different projection conditions. Since it is expected that the use of SAR can be promoted by overcoming the discussed technical limitations and possible solution application, this study aims to traceability provide the whole process of BIM-based SAR for architectural design collaboration.},

The Game Experience Questionnaire has a modular structure and consists of :1.	The core questionnaire2.	The Social Presence Module3.	The Post-game module.In addition to these modules, a concise in-game version of the GEQ was developed.All three modules are meant to be administered immediately after the game-session has finished, in the order given above. Part one and two probe the players’ feelings and thoughts while playing the game; Part 3, the post-game module, assesses how players felt after they had stopped playing.Part 1 is the core part of the GEQ. It assesses game experience as scores on seven components: Immersion, Flow, Competence, Positive and Negative Affect, Tension, and Challenge. For a robust measure, we need five items per component. As translation of questionnaire items, no matter how carefully performed, sometimes results in suboptimal scoring patterns, we have added a spare item to all components. After the first use of the translated GEQs, scale analyses will be performed to check whether any item should be discarded or replaced.Part 2, the social presence module, investigates psychological and behavioural involvement of the player with other social entities, be they virtual (i.e., in-game characters), mediated (e.g., others playing online), or co-located. This module should only be administered when at least one of these types of co-players were involved in the game.Part 3, the post-game module, assesses how players felt after they had stopped playing. This is a relevant module for assessing naturalistic gaming (i.e., when gamers have voluntarily decided to play), but may also be relevant in experimental research.The In-game version of the GEQ is a concise version of the core questionnaire. It has an identical component structure and consists of items selected from this module. The in-game questionnaire is developed for assessing game experience at multiple intervals during a game session, or play-back session. This should facilitate the validation of continuous and real-time indicators some of the partners in the FUGA project are developing.},

While VR environments can deeply immerse the person wearing the headset, spectators are often not actively involved or are not even considered in the design phase. This is an issue for learning environments, as learning often takes place in pairs or groups. We propose a novel system that enables more than one person to join the VR world in a co-located space to overcome this problem. In addition to the classic VR headset, the asymmetric VR system features a position-tracked tablet. To evaluate this asymmetric VR concept, we conducted a study with 14 students to explore the user experience and motivation, the social presence, and possible further fields of application. The results indicate that users in both perspectives feel that they can control the virtual world.},

	abstract = {Many people develop lasting social bonds by playing games together, and there are a variety of games available so that individuals are likely to find games that appeal to their specific play preferences, abilities, and available time. However, there are many instances where people might want to play together, but would normally choose vastly different games for themselves, due to these various asymmetries in play experiences, such as grandparents and grandchildren, highly skilled players and novices, or even simply two players that enjoy different games. In this work, we aim to improve the design of asymmetric games-games that are designed to embrace and leverage differences between players to improve multiplayer engagement. This paper builds upon prior work to describe the elements of asymmetry that can be used to design such games, and uses these elements in the design of an asymmetric game, Beam Me 'Round Scotty'! We present the results of a thematic analysis of a player experience study, discuss these findings, and propose an initial conceptual framework for discussion of design elements relevant to asymmetric games.},

	abstract = {Understanding the nature and influence of social relationships is of increasing interest to behavioral economists, and behavioral scientists more generally. In turn, this creates a need for tractable, and reliable, tools for measuring fundamental aspects of social relationships. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the 'Inclusion of the Other in the Self' (IOS) Scale, a handy pictorial tool for measuring the subjectively perceived closeness of a relationship. The tool is highly portable, very easy for subjects to understand and takes less than 1 minute to administer. Across our three online studies with a diverse adult population (n = 772) we show that six different scales designed to measure relationship closeness are all highly significantly positively correlated with the IOS Scale. We then conduct a Principal Component Analysis to construct an Index of Relationship Closeness and find that it correlates very strongly (ρ = 85) with the IOS Scale. We conclude that the IOS Scale is a psychologically meaningful and highly reliable measure of the subjective closeness of relationships.},

For example, sighted players have a multitude of highly visual games at their disposal, while blind players may choose from a variety of audio games. Attempts at improving cross-ability access to any of those are often limited in the experience they provide, or disregard multiplayer experiences. We explore ability-based asymmetric roles as a design approach to create engaging and challenging mixed-ability play. Our team designed and developed two collaborative testbed games exploring asymmetric interdependent roles. In a remote study with 13 mixed-visual-ability pairs we assessed how roles affected perceptions of engagement, competence, and autonomy, using a mixed-methods approach. The games provided an engaging and challenging experience, in which differences in visual ability were not limiting. Our results underline how experiences unequal by design can give rise to an equitable joint experience.},

Subsequently, we analyse and discuss this data to identify generalisability in these games. In our discussion we identify how these findings address game design problems of designing collaborative games. Furthermore, we contribute to theory of designing for social play from the perspectives of co-located mobile contexts in game design by identifying how mobility: (1) affords co-locating with other players in public spaces, (2) supports physical interactions using spatial context and players bodies, extending games beyond their formal system, (3) supports asymmetric design with information and interaction. Finally we contribute the concept of a pocket magic circle, a particular magic circle, to support a focus on game design leveraging these intersecting properties.},

	abstract = {Outstanding multiplayer games engage players by providing rich social interactions. Yet, it is still not clear how to purposefully design these interactions. Our paper tackles this issue by establishing a research model for social player interaction highlighting the impact of the game design, the player group, and the gaming setting. Based on that model, we investigated the influence of three particular game design patterns - player interdependence, time pressure, and shared control - on the interaction of players. For that purpose, we developed a co-located game to systematically test variations of those patterns. We analyzed the resulting player experience and social interaction by applying questionnaires and videotaping game play sessions. Results indicate that high player interdependence implies more communication and less frustration, whereas shared control results in less perceived competence and autonomy. Moreover, individual player characteristics also impact the social interaction.},

As digital games are often played in social contexts, social phenomena and processes are an important part of game user research and supposed to have significant impact on the overall player experience. Gameplay metrics have been used as one method to measure player behavior, but have not been applied to detect social aspects of play yet. We present the conceptualization, application, and evaluation of three social gameplay metrics that aim at measuring social presence, cooperation, and leadership, respectively. A comparison of the metrics' data with scores of self-report measures addressing the same concepts shows high positive correlations, thus indicating reliability of the metrics.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is a relevant technology, which has demonstrated to be efficient for several applications, especially in the architecture, engineering, construction and operation (AECO) domain, where the integration of building information modeling (BIM) and AR has proved to be optimal in handling construction projects. However, the main challenge when integrating a virtual 3D model in an AR environment is the lack of precision and accuracy of placement that can occur between the real and the virtual environments. Although methods for placement via AR have been reported in the literature, there is a lack of investigations addressing their evaluation. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology to perform a quantitative and qualitative assessment of several AR placement methods and a discussion about their usability in the specific context of AECO. We adopt root mean square error (RMSE) to quantify the placement accuracy of a 3D model and standard deviation to examine its stability (jittering). The results revealed that the AR placement error range is extremely wide (from a few centimeters up to meters). In marker-based methods, the results showed centimeter-range in both indoor and outdoor environments, compared to other methods (Inertial, Marker-less, etc.), while marker-less methods have widely varying error range from centimeters to a few meters. Other commercial solutions based on placement-sensors (GNSS and IMU), such as Trimble SiteVision, have proven placement performance in manual mode with centimeter order, while for the automatic mode, the order of placement and stability is metric, due to the low coverage of RTX (real time extended) in the study area.},

	abstract = {This study into the nature of “the floor” actually began as an open-ended inquiry into sex differences that might occur beyond the sentence level in the multi-party interaction of five informal committee meetings. Technical difficulties prompted the trying out of several different transcription displays, most of which failed to capture the “feel” of the interaction and each of which biased (in its own way) the perception of what had actually gone on. The type of unconventional display eventually used was intended to show the floor holder in the center of the page, flanked by co-occurring talk. Because there were many episodes for which a single floor holder could not be identified, the primary focus of the study shifted to the nature of the floor itself. Questions about sex differences became a secondary and succeeding focus.In the analysis, “floor” and “turn” were distinguished on the basis of “participant-sense” rather than technical criteria. Two kinds of floors were subjectively identified: F1, a singly developed floor; and F2, a collaborative venture where several people seemed to be either operating on the same wavelength or engaging in a free-for-all. The two kinds of floors were differentiated objectively by such features as quantity and frequency participation, language functions, number of nonturn utterances, overlaps, and pauses. There were indeed sex/language differences, but these were related to the type of floor being developed. Men took more and longer turns and did more of the joking, arguing, directing, and soliciting of responses F1 's. Turn length and frequency differences were neutralized in F2's, and certain language functions were used by women to a greater extent in F2's than in F1 's.

As a result, designers have little guidance on which multiplayer game mechanics are most effective. We summarize literature on game design for social closeness into a framework with two collaborative mechanics: cooperation and interdependence. We then created four versions of an online game to independently test the effects of these game mechanics on relationship formation between paired online strangers, showing that cooperation and interdependence are two distinct factors that both can be used to improve play experience and increase social bonds. Additionally, we unpack the effect of interdependence, showing that the improved social closeness can be explained by the increase in conversational turns.},

This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for "quick and dirty" methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation. This chapter describes the System Usability Scale (SUS) a reliable, low-cost usability scale that can be used for global assessments of systems usability.},

In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

The taxonomy builds on the MDA framework and Activity Theory (AT) as top-level attributes, and offers the analytical dimensions WHAT, WHO, WHEN and HOW, each containing a number of sub-categories, for evaluating different levels of collaborative interaction mediated by games. The work is based on a three stage process: design of game instances, data collection, and analysis of play sessions. This taxonomy is an initial step towards capturing the complexity of collaboration mediated by games, and helps in understanding and studying collaboration as a phenomena in game design. Our preliminary work provides a characterization of multiple dimensions of collaborative interaction, providing game designers a starting point for deeper understanding into collaborative interaction mediated by a collocated gameplay.},

	abstract = {Research has identified applications of handheld-based VR, which utilizes handheld displays or mobile devices, for developing systems that involve users in mixed reality (MR) without the need for head-worn displays (HWDs). Such systems can potentially accommodate large groups of users participating in MR. However, we lack an understanding of how group sizes and interaction methods affect the user experience. In this paper, we aim to advance our understanding of handheld-based MR in the context of multiplayer, co-located games. We conducted a study (N = 38) to understand how user experiences vary by group size (2, 4, and 8) and interaction method (proximity-based or pointing-based). For our experiment, we implemented a multiuser experience for up to ten users. We found that proximity-based interaction that encouraged dynamic movement positively affected social presence and physical/temporal workload. In bigger group settings, participants felt less challenged and less positive. Individuals had varying preferences for group size and interaction type. The findings of the study will advance our understanding of the design space for handheld-based MR in terms of group sizes and interaction schemes. To make our contributions explicit, we conclude our paper with design implications that can inform user experience design in handheld-based mixed reality contexts.},

	title = {Player {Typology} in {Theory} and {Practice}},
	abstract = {Player satisfaction modeling depends in part upon quantitative or qualitative typologies of playing preferences, although such approaches require scrutiny. Examination of psychometric typologies reveal that type theories have—except in rare cases—proven inadequate and have made way for alternative trait theories. This suggests any future player typology that will be sufficiently robust will need foundations in the form of a trait theory of playing preferences. This paper tracks the development of a sequence of player typologies developing from psychometric type theory roots towards an independently validated trait theory of play, albeit one yet to be fully developed. Statistical analysis of the results of one survey in this lineage is presented, along with a discussion of theoretical and practical ways in which the surveys and their implied typological instruments have evolved. INTRODUCTION Categorizing entities based on their common characteristics allows for faster cognitive processing of complex systems, a motivation that underlies psychological typologies, as well as any attempt to classify players according to their playing preferences. This paper discusses a sequence of demographic studies aimed at developing a player typology along lines that parallel psychometric typologies, and considers the theoretical and pragmatic requirements that any such typology must address.},

However, their application to long audio transcription via buffered or sliding window approaches is prone to drifting, hallucination \& repetition; and prohibits batched transcription due to their sequential nature. Further, timestamps corresponding each utterance are prone to inaccuracies and word-level timestamps are not available out-of-the-box. To overcome these challenges, we present WhisperX, a time-accurate speech recognition system with word-level timestamps utilising voice activity detection and forced phoneme alignment. In doing so, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on long-form transcription and word segmentation benchmarks. Additionally, we show that pre-segmenting audio with our proposed VAD Cut \& Merge strategy improves transcription quality and enables a twelve-fold transcription speedup via batched inference.},

	abstract = {Interactive fictions, or text-adventures, are games in which a player interacts with a world entirely through textual descriptions and text actions. Text-adventure games are typically structured as puzzles or quests wherein the player must execute certain actions in a certain order to succeed. In this paper, we consider the problem of procedurally generating a quest, defined as a series of actions required to progress towards a goal, in a text-adventure game. Quest generation in text environments is challenging because they must be semantically coherent. We present and evaluate two quest generation techniques: (1) a Markov model, and (2) a neural generative model. We specifically look at generating quests about cooking and train our models on recipe data. We evaluate our techniques with human participant studies looking at perceived creativity and coherence.},

In the current study, a factor analytic approach was used to create an empirical model of player motivations. The analysis revealed 10 motivation subcomponents that grouped into three overarching components (achievement, social, and immersion). Relationships between motivations and demographic variables (age, gender, and usage patterns) are also presented.},

	abstract = {This paper briefly presents a player satisfaction model called BrainHex, which was based on insights from neurobiological findings as well as the results from earlier demographic game design models (DGD1 and DGD2). The model presents seven different archetypes of players: Seeker, Survivor, Daredevil, Mastermind, Conqueror, Socialiser, and Achiever. We explain how each of these player archetypes relates to older player typologies (such as Myers-Briggs), and how each archetype characterizes a specific playing style. We conducted a survey among more than 50,000 players using the BrainHex model as a personality type motivator to gather and compare demographic data to the different BrainHex archetypes. We discuss some results from this survey with a focus on psychometric orientation of respondents, to establish relationships between personality types and BrainHex archetypes.},
