This project aims to understand whether adding artefacts from the physical world into the virtual world (Augmented-virtuality) increases sense of presence and enhances the efficacy of an Intelligent Virtual Agent (IVA) to achieve its intended purpose. A study was designed where the purpose of the IVA was to reduce study stress in students. The between-subjects experiment involved 50 participants in two groups: The Augmented-virtual group and the Virtual group. The Augmented-virtual group experienced a Virtual Reality (VR) environment augmented with a chair and coffee table also experienced in the real world. The Virtual group experienced the same VR environment without augmentation; the real chair does not match the virtual chair and the virtual coffee table does not exist in the real world. Self-reporting and heart rate were analysed to measure stress levels. Self-reporting indicated significant changes in study stress (participants’ cognitive level) for both groups. However, measurement of stress via heart rate (participants’ physical level) was significantly reduced for the Augmented-virtual group, who also reported higher presence. Presence instruments only revealed significant differences for items relevant to visual aspects, as other aspects were not manipulated. We conclude that augmenting virtual worlds with elements concurrently experienced in the real world may increase sense of presence and enhance simulation efficacy, e.g. increased stress reduction, when compared to the use of VR only.},

To this end, we reviewed the scientific literature across many disciplines, including psychology, computer science, and game theory. This literature review led to key insights and an attempt to develop a framework grounded in Reinforcement Learning Theory with the ambition of integrating a diversity of disparate scientific results but also to provide a lens through which to study existing multiplayer games as well as drive the development of research video games for studying and improving collaboration and collaboration skills. We will review commercial multiplayer games to identify key concepts and mechanics that game designers use for engaging collaborative gameplay. We will then develop game prototypes based on both our theoretical framework and our video game reviews and conduct small-scale user tests to help us identify the most promising ideas and to iteratively update the framework and game design for future large-scale experimental studies. Here we present key ideas behind this project; it is still in its early stages and could greatly benefit from discussions with the CHI-Play community.},

It includes a significant amount of cut content — characters, locations, and backstory that never made it into the final game. There’s also quite a bit of concept art, although much of this is in Grim Fandango Remastered.
Virtually all of the information contained within the Puzzle Document is being integrated into the ‘behind the scenes’ sections of our character and location pages.

Eighty participants were assigned to play a violent video game cooperatively or competitively with a confederate posing as an outgroup or ingroup member.

Furthermore, cooperation with an outgroup member can actually reduce aggression. Implications of findings for future research are discussed.},

However, investigating AR concepts outdoors, especially on-the-move, has proven to be a challenging task. Although previous work has examined use cases for using AR for everyday activities in urban environments, most of the contexts explored with people being on-the-move outdoors are in a conceptual stage and these contexts mainly regard AR from a utilitarian perspective. This thesis’ goal is to design and evaluate meaningful AR concepts that intend to assist people while on-the-move in a context sensitive and personalized manner, hoping to empower them by leveraging new forms of interaction while merging the virtual and physical world. I aim to contribute an overview of the design space for AR, while people are on-the-move, provide insights for meaningful AR visualizations, and establish design guidelines for such concepts.},

The IADS-2 is a standardized database of 167 naturally occurring sounds that is widely used in the study of emotions. The sounds were rated by 300 college students who were native speakers of EP, in the three affective dimensions of valence, arousal, and dominance, by using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). The aims of this adaptation were threefold: (1) to provide researchers with standardized and normatively rated affective sounds to be used with an EP population; (2) to investigate sex and cultural differences in the ratings of affective dimensions of auditory stimuli between EP and the American (Bradley \& Lang, 2007a) and Spanish (Fernández-Abascal et al., Psicothema 20:104-113 2008; Redondo, Fraga, Padrón, \& Piñeiro, Behavior Research Methods 40:784-790 2008) standardizations; and (3) to promote research on auditory affective processing in Portugal. Our results indicated that the IADS-2 is a valid and useful database of digitized sounds for the study of emotions in a Portuguese context, allowing for comparisons of its results with those of other international studies that have used the same database for stimulus selection. The normative values of the EP adaptation of the IADS-2 database can be downloaded along with the online version of this article.},

The game explores asymmetric co-operative gaming in a shared physical space, taking the physical surroundings of the VR user into account in its design. Asymmetric games feature different rules, abilities, or objectives for different players, generating unique and nuanced game experiences. Multiplayer asymmetric games in particular have been shown to increase teamwork and a collaborative mindset even after a play session has ended. Asymmetric design is commonplace in both digital and analog games but has yet to see widespread adoption in the emerging Virtual Reality (VR) gaming space. BirdQuestVR seeks to leverage the affordances of current consumer-grade VR headsets to build asymmetric gameplay around communication, embodied performance, and physical humour.},

With the success of games like Left4Dead, many game designers and producers are currently exploring the addition of cooperative patterns within their games. Unfortunately, very little research investigated cooperative patterns or methods to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a set of cooperative patterns identified based on analysis of fourteen cooperative games. Additionally, we propose Cooperative Performance Metrics (CPM). To evaluate the use of these CPMs, we ran a study with a total of 60 participants, grouped in 2-3 participants per session. Participants were asked to play four cooperative games (Rock Band 2, Lego Star Wars, Kameo, and Little Big Planet). Videos of the play sessions were annotated using the CPMs, which were then mapped to cooperative patterns that caused them. Results, validated through inter-rater agreement, identify several effective cooperative patterns and lessons for future cooperative game designs.},

Dabei werden auch Realitätskonstruktionen und deren Wirkung diskutiert. Im dritten Schritt werden zentrale Fragen der Massenkommunikation geklärt. Nach grundlegenden Überlegungen und einer Definition des Medienbegriffs werden drei Perspektiven auf Massenkommunikation eröffnet: Aus der Kommunikatorperspektive werden Modelle der Nachrichtenauswahl und Nachrichtenstrukturierung diskutiert. Aus der Perspektive von Mediennutzung und Medienrezeption werden sowohl theoretische Modelle als auch praktische und ökonomische Aspekte angewandter Mediaforschung vorgestellt. Aus der Wirkungsperspektive werden schließlich die wichtigsten Ansätze zu verschiedenen Arten von Medienwirkungen erörtert.},

We addressed this issue based on the frequency of traditional communication such as face-to-face and non-face-to-face communication (e.g., phone, email, and letters). Methods In total, 8,576 individuals participated, including 2,543 aged 18–39, 3,048 aged 40–64, and 2,985 aged over 65 years. They were asked to indicate their frequency of SNS usage, both for posting and checking, of LINE (a popular message application in Japan), Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, with frequent usage defined as posting or checking more than a few times a week. To determine mental health status, WHO-5 (i.e., well-being), K6 (i.e., distress symptoms), and feelings of loneliness were assessed. Multiple and logistic regression analyses were adjusted for the frequency of traditional communication. To avoid type 1 error, a Bonferroni correction of p ≤ 0.002 was applied in the regression models (p = 0.05/18, a number of regression models). Results The most frequently used SNS across the three age groups was LINE; frequent usage (both posting and checking) among older adults was independently associated with better well-being. Frequent posting on Facebook was associated with better well-being in middle-aged adults. Young adults who frequently checked on Instagram showed a tendency toward better well-being and lower distress symptoms. On the contrary, frequent usage of Twitter was associated with distress symptoms or feelings of loneliness across all three age groups. Conclusions We found generational and SNS-type-dependent negative and positive associations between SNS use and mental health, indicating the possible influences of SNS use and the importance of non-SNS communication.},

We believe that augmented reality is a natural interface to visualize spacial information such as position or direction of locations and objects for location based applications that process and present information based on the user's position in the real world. To enable such applications we construct an indoor tracking system that covers a substantial part of a building. It is based on visual tracking of fiducial markers enhanced with an inertial sensor for fast rotational updates. To scale such a system to a whole building we introduce a space partitioning scheme to reuse fiducial markers throughout the environment. Finally we demonstrate two location based applications built upon this facility, an indoor navigation aid and a library search application.},

	abstract = {Diese Studie zielt darauf ab, Unterschiede in der User Experience von 3D-Karten Anwendungen im Nutzungskontext Skitourenplanung festzustellen, um Erkenntnisse über die Vor- und Nachteile zu gewinnen. Es findet ein Vergleich zwischen der Touchscreen Applikation „Fatmap“1 (FATMAP {\textbar} Discover a world of adventure..., o. J.) und einem auf der Basis mobiler Augmented Reality entwickelten Prototypen statt. Um die Usability zu untersuchen, wurden Evaluationen zur Messung der Faktoren Effektivität, Effizienz und Zufriedenheit durchgeführt. Auf Grundlage der Ergebnisse wurde zudem ein Vorbereitungstool für eine alpine Skitour entwickelt. Für den Versuchsaufbau wurde zu Beginn die prototypische mobile AR-Applikation dem UX-Design Prozess folgend aufgesetzt. In dieser Phase fand eine tiefgreifende Recherche zu den Themen Orientierung, Interaktion und Skitouren statt, woraus die Anforderungen und das Konzept für den Prototyp abgeleitet wurden. Dieser wurde mit Hilfe einer Online-Plattform umgesetzt und auf einem iPad evaluiert. Das Testdesign beinhaltet Fragebögen zur wahrgenommenen User Experience, einen Usability Test zur Messung der Effizienz und einen Usability Test zur Messung der Effektivität. Insgesamt wurden 17 Proband: innen mit beiden Applikationen evaluiert, die gemessenen Faktoren ausgewertet und interpretiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass es Unterschiede bei der Effizienz und der Zufriedenheit der Anwendungen gibt, aber auch die Effektivität wird kontrovers diskutiert. Die Erkenntnisse bestätigen Vorteile bei der Interaktion mit dem AR-Prototypen, lassen jedoch offen, ob sich Nachteile der Effektivität durch technische Verbesserungen eliminieren lassen. In jedem Fall wurde die AR-Anwendung als spannender und origineller wahrgenommen, was zu einer höheren Motivation führt.},

To stay ahead of their competitors in entertainment, game developers need to understand, estimate, and maximize player engagement. We address the multidimensional nature of engagement, encompassing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects across various gaming domains. We present a taxonomy of the diverse modalities for quantifying engagement, including physiological signals, observable behaviors, and gameplay data. We identify the challenges of conducting representative subjective studies in this domain and summarize various methods for establishing ground truth measurements. By synthesizing existing research, we provide insights into modeling techniques, highlight research gaps, and offer practical guidelines for implementing engagement measurement strategies. This review aims to aid researchers and industry professionals in navigating the complexities of player engagement estimation, ultimately contributing to enhanced game design, marketing, and user retention in the competitive gaming landscape.},

However, excessive gaming could have negative consequences. The purpose of the study was to understand the relationship between video gaming and the mental health of young adults, globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the relationship between video gaming and the mental health of young adults during the pandemic. The study followed PRISMA 2020 and conducted a comprehensive literature search in multiple databases: PubMed Central (PMC), Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We found 11 relevant articles published between March 2020 and March 2023, predominantly using online questionnaires and focused on young adults, mostly college students. The findings showed that video gaming had both positive and negative influences on psychological well-being. It served as a coping mechanism for young adults dealing with stress and isolation, providing a sense of belongingness. However, excessive gaming disrupted social interaction and family relationships. Regular gamers were found to adapt better to the virtual environment. The findings highlight calls for accessible mental health resources and awareness to maintain healthy gaming behavior.},

Yet, we have limited means to rigorously define or communicate the structures that govern these experiences, hindering attempts at consolidating knowledge and limiting the potential of design efforts. In this work, we introduce the Living Framework for Cooperative Games (LFCG), a framework derived from a multi-step systematic analysis of 129 cooperative games with contributions of eleven researchers. We describe how LFCG can be used as a tool for analyses and ideation, and as a shared language for describing a game’s design. LFCG is published as a web application to facilitate use and appropriation. It supports the creation, dissemination and aggregation of game reports and specifications; and enables stakeholders to extend and publish custom versions. Lastly, we discuss using a research-driven approach for formalising game structures and the advantages of community contributions for consolidation and reach.},

Designing games that cater to these differences remains an open challenge. In this paper, we first identify barriers related with time and expertise. Next, we propose asymmetric game design and asynchronous play to reconcile children's and adults' requirements; and interdependent gameplay mechanics to foster real-world interactions. Following this approach, we designed a testbed game and conducted a mixed-methods remote study with six pairs of adult-child family members. Our results showcase how asymmetric, asynchronous experiences can be leveraged to create novel gaming experiences that meet the requirements of family play. We discuss how interdependent progress can be designed to promote real-world interactions, creating pervasive conversational topics that permeate the family routine.},

Often this requires establishing ad-hoc workgroups that come together to address a new problem over a short period of time. In these cases, it is important that group members can work together effectively in a short amount of time. We are interested in understanding how computer-based "icebreaking" video games can help group members work together in real world collaborations. To do this, we identified icebreaking video game requirements based on the literature and ran an experiment with ad-hoc workgroups within an organization to assess the effect of playing an icebreaking video game before one of their collaborative work tasks. We compared groups that participated in the icebreaking video game prior to the work task with those that did not. We found that groups that played the icebreaking video game demonstrated increased collaboration in the subsequent work task.},

We explain how each of these player archetypes relates to older player typologies (such as Myers-Briggs), and how each archetype characterizes a specific playing style. We conducted a survey among more than 50,000 players using the BrainHex model as a personality type motivator to gather and compare demographic data to the different BrainHex archetypes. We discuss some results from this survey with a focus on psychometric orientation of respondents, to establish relationships between personality types and BrainHex archetypes.},

	abstract = {Mixed Reality (MR) visual displays, a particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies, involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere along the 'virtuality continuum' which connects completely real environments to completely virtual ones. Augmented Reality (AR), probably the best known of these, refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However quite different groupings are possible and this demonstrates the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. An approximately three-dimensional taxonomy is proposed comprising the following dimensions: extent of world knowledge, reproduction fidelity, and extent of presence metaphor.},

Subjects (N = 116) competed in a basketball free-throw shooting game, following which they completed the IMI. The LISREL VI computer program was employed to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to assess the tenability of a five factor hierarchical model representing four first-order factors or dimensions and a second-order general factor representing intrinsic motivation. Indices of model acceptability tentatively suggest that the sport data adequately fit the hypothesized five factor hierarchical model. Alternative models were tested but did not result in significant improvements in the goodness-of-fit indices, suggesting the proposed model to be the most accurate of the models tested. Coefficient alphas for the four dimensions and the overall scale indicated adequate reliability. The results are discussed with regard to the importance of accurate assessment of psychological constructs and the use of linear structural equations in confirming the factor structures of measures.},

	abstract = {Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, social interactions were constrained by physical distancing guidelines. Consequently, some individuals may have turned to video games to cope with isolation and negative emotions. Previous studies have shown that people who struggle with anxiety and depression are at particular risk for developing problem gaming behaviours. However, there is a paucity of longitudinal research testing pathways from negative emotionality to problem gaming behaviours, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we conducted a multi-wave longitudinal study and predicted that high levels of emotional vulnerability (anxiety and depression) in the first month of the pandemic would prospectively relate to elevated time spent gaming and related problems six months later. We also predicted that elevated coping motives for gaming would mediate these associations. A sample of 332 Canadian gamers (Mage = 33.79; 60.8\% men) completed three surveys on Prolific, with the first occurring in April 2020 (one-month after the declared COVID-19 state of emergency) and subsequent surveys were spaced three months apart. High initial levels of emotional vulnerability predicted excessive time spent gaming, as well as related problems, six months into the pandemic. Elevated coping motives for gaming uniquely mediated these pathways. This longitudinal study is the first to show that negative emotionality was a vulnerability factor for coping-related problem gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we continue to cope with the longer-lasting impacts of the pandemic, it will be important for individuals who struggle with mood and anxiety issues to find more effective ways of coping.},

	abstract = {Different Augmented Reality (AR) displays are becoming more commonly used for work since AR promises benefits by offering support, e.g., with additional information or hints. However, most research compares AR with traditional work support, like paper-based or web-based instructions. Since various AR technologies offer device-specific advantages and disadvantages, different AR technologies are more or less suitable to offer support without overwhelming or distracting the worker. Research, therefore, needs to derive empirical results from comparing different AR displays to derive concrete recommendations for action on the use and design of AR for specific contexts. To address this research gap, this experimental study investigates the effect of video-see-through head-mounted AR (Varjo XR-3) vs. handheld AR (Apple iPad) on performance (time and committed failure), motivation, and cognitive load for guided assembly. The study results reveal that both AR displays can successfully guide people in guided assembly tasks. On a descriptive level, the head-mounted AR device reveals slightly better results in terms of time and committed failures. Notably, the impact of technical restrictions on the study results was still evident. Accordingly, further investigation of device-specific differences is of continuing importance.},

The underlying idea is always the same: players have to solve many diverse puzzles to (virtually) escape from a locked room. Within the last decade, we witnessed a rapidly increasing popularity of such games, which also amplified the amount of related research. However, the respective academic landscape is mostly fragmented in its current state, lacking a common model and vocabulary that would withstand these games' variety. This manuscript aims to establish such a foundation for the analysis and construction of escape rooms. In a first step, we derive a high-level design framework from prior literature. Then, as our main contribution, we establish an atomic puzzle taxonomy that closes the gap between the analog and digital domains. The taxonomy is developed in multiple steps: we compose a basic structure based on previous literature and systematically refine it by analyzing 39 analog and digital escape room games, including recent virtual reality representatives. The final taxonomy consists of mental, physical, and emotional challenges, thereby providing a robust and approachable basis for future works across all application domains that deal with escape rooms or puzzles in general.},

Previous studies have shown that asymmetric virtual reality (VR) games —games that utilize and consider differences of various kinds— can improve users’ social and player experience. However, the impact of existing social factors on users’ experiences is still unknown in asymmetric games. In this paper, we designed and implemented an asymmetric game in which both players are in VR. In the game, players had to exchange asymmetric information to complete tasks, resulting in a strategic interdependence. We studied how familiarity (friends vs. strangers) affects social and player experience, as well as game performance. In our preliminary between-participants study (N=14), we did not find significant differences between the friend and stranger teams in social and player experience, or game performance. We discuss how asymmetries can be used to create social VR games, and how and why familiarity does (not) affect the experience of players.},

We win or lose the game in the real world, but we slay a dragon (for example) only in the world of the game. In this thought-provoking study, Jesper Juul examines the constantly evolving tension between rules and fiction in video games. Discussing games from Pong to The Legend of Zelda, from chess to Grand Theft Auto, he shows how video games are both a departure from and a development of traditional non-electronic games. The book combines perspectives from such fields as literary and film theory, computer science, psychology, economic game theory, and game studies to outline a theory of what video games are, how they work with the player, how they have developed historically, and why they are fun to play." "Locating video games in a history of games that goes back to Ancient Egypt, Juul argues that there is a basic affinity between games and computers. Just as the printing press and the cinema have promoted and enabled new kinds of storytelling, computers work as enablers of games, letting us play old games in new ways and allowing for new kinds of games that would not have been possible before computers. Juul presents a classic game model, which describes the traditional construction of games and points to possible future developments. He examines how rules provide challenges, learning, and enjoyment for players, and how a game cues the player into imagining its fictional world. Juul's lively style and eclectic deployment of sources will make Half-Real of interest to media, literature, and game scholars as well as to game professionals and gamers."--BOOK JACKET; Includes bibliographical references (p.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology, such as augmented reality (AR), has served as the display for building information modeling (BIM)-based architectural design collaboration to provide more effective design observation and communication for stakeholders. That said, AR has several technical limitations in terms of personal device issues, user experience, and visualization quality. A new form of AR called spatial augmented reality (SAR) has been introduced to address these issues, which uses a digital projector to present graphics on physical objects for augmenting real-world objects. Therefore, SAR has great benefits and potentials to combine with BIM for design collaboration. This paper introduces a BIM-based SAR operational framework, where 3D building models generated from BIM software are imported to projection mapping tools to display building surface textures on physical white building models. A case study using Revit and 3ds Max as the BIM software, and MadMapper as the projection mapping tool, was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework and to evaluate the projection performance of SAR. The case study showed that the texture of BIM models could be projected on the objects clearly and realistically. Additionally, the proposed SAR method potentially offers intuitive observation of building models and comfortable wear-free experience for collaborative design, and the qualitative analysis by changing the parameters was conducted to test the different projection conditions. Since it is expected that the use of SAR can be promoted by overcoming the discussed technical limitations and possible solution application, this study aims to traceability provide the whole process of BIM-based SAR for architectural design collaboration.},

	abstract = {This document contains the English version of the Game Experience Questionnaire. The development and testing of the Game Experience Questionnaire is described in project Deliverable 3.3. The Game Experience Questionnaire has a modular structure and consists of :1.	The core questionnaire2.	The Social Presence Module3.	The Post-game module.In addition to these modules, a concise in-game version of the GEQ was developed.All three modules are meant to be administered immediately after the game-session has finished, in the order given above. Part one and two probe the players’ feelings and thoughts while playing the game; Part 3, the post-game module, assesses how players felt after they had stopped playing.Part 1 is the core part of the GEQ. It assesses game experience as scores on seven components: Immersion, Flow, Competence, Positive and Negative Affect, Tension, and Challenge. For a robust measure, we need five items per component. As translation of questionnaire items, no matter how carefully performed, sometimes results in suboptimal scoring patterns, we have added a spare item to all components. After the first use of the translated GEQs, scale analyses will be performed to check whether any item should be discarded or replaced.Part 2, the social presence module, investigates psychological and behavioural involvement of the player with other social entities, be they virtual (i.e., in-game characters), mediated (e.g., others playing online), or co-located. This module should only be administered when at least one of these types of co-players were involved in the game.Part 3, the post-game module, assesses how players felt after they had stopped playing. This is a relevant module for assessing naturalistic gaming (i.e., when gamers have voluntarily decided to play), but may also be relevant in experimental research.The In-game version of the GEQ is a concise version of the core questionnaire. It has an identical component structure and consists of items selected from this module. The in-game questionnaire is developed for assessing game experience at multiple intervals during a game session, or play-back session. This should facilitate the validation of continuous and real-time indicators some of the partners in the FUGA project are developing.},

While VR environments can deeply immerse the person wearing the headset, spectators are often not actively involved or are not even considered in the design phase. This is an issue for learning environments, as learning often takes place in pairs or groups. We propose a novel system that enables more than one person to join the VR world in a co-located space to overcome this problem. In addition to the classic VR headset, the asymmetric VR system features a position-tracked tablet. To evaluate this asymmetric VR concept, we conducted a study with 14 students to explore the user experience and motivation, the social presence, and possible further fields of application. The results indicate that users in both perspectives feel that they can control the virtual world.},

	abstract = {Many people develop lasting social bonds by playing games together, and there are a variety of games available so that individuals are likely to find games that appeal to their specific play preferences, abilities, and available time. However, there are many instances where people might want to play together, but would normally choose vastly different games for themselves, due to these various asymmetries in play experiences, such as grandparents and grandchildren, highly skilled players and novices, or even simply two players that enjoy different games. In this work, we aim to improve the design of asymmetric games-games that are designed to embrace and leverage differences between players to improve multiplayer engagement. This paper builds upon prior work to describe the elements of asymmetry that can be used to design such games, and uses these elements in the design of an asymmetric game, Beam Me 'Round Scotty'! We present the results of a thematic analysis of a player experience study, discuss these findings, and propose an initial conceptual framework for discussion of design elements relevant to asymmetric games.},

In turn, this creates a need for tractable, and reliable, tools for measuring fundamental aspects of social relationships. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the 'Inclusion of the Other in the Self' (IOS) Scale, a handy pictorial tool for measuring the subjectively perceived closeness of a relationship. The tool is highly portable, very easy for subjects to understand and takes less than 1 minute to administer. Across our three online studies with a diverse adult population (n = 772) we show that six different scales designed to measure relationship closeness are all highly significantly positively correlated with the IOS Scale. We then conduct a Principal Component Analysis to construct an Index of Relationship Closeness and find that it correlates very strongly (ρ = 85) with the IOS Scale. We conclude that the IOS Scale is a psychologically meaningful and highly reliable measure of the subjective closeness of relationships.},

Attempts at improving cross-ability access to any of those are often limited in the experience they provide, or disregard multiplayer experiences. We explore ability-based asymmetric roles as a design approach to create engaging and challenging mixed-ability play. Our team designed and developed two collaborative testbed games exploring asymmetric interdependent roles. In a remote study with 13 mixed-visual-ability pairs we assessed how roles affected perceptions of engagement, competence, and autonomy, using a mixed-methods approach. The games provided an engaging and challenging experience, in which differences in visual ability were not limiting. Our results underline how experiences unequal by design can give rise to an equitable joint experience.},

Furthermore, we contribute to theory of designing for social play from the perspectives of co-located mobile contexts in game design by identifying how mobility: (1) affords co-locating with other players in public spaces, (2) supports physical interactions using spatial context and players bodies, extending games beyond their formal system, (3) supports asymmetric design with information and interaction. Finally we contribute the concept of a pocket magic circle, a particular magic circle, to support a focus on game design leveraging these intersecting properties.},

Our paper tackles this issue by establishing a research model for social player interaction highlighting the impact of the game design, the player group, and the gaming setting. Based on that model, we investigated the influence of three particular game design patterns - player interdependence, time pressure, and shared control - on the interaction of players. For that purpose, we developed a co-located game to systematically test variations of those patterns. We analyzed the resulting player experience and social interaction by applying questionnaires and videotaping game play sessions. Results indicate that high player interdependence implies more communication and less frustration, whereas shared control results in less perceived competence and autonomy. Moreover, individual player characteristics also impact the social interaction.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is a relevant technology, which has demonstrated to be efficient for several applications, especially in the architecture, engineering, construction and operation (AECO) domain, where the integration of building information modeling (BIM) and AR has proved to be optimal in handling construction projects. However, the main challenge when integrating a virtual 3D model in an AR environment is the lack of precision and accuracy of placement that can occur between the real and the virtual environments. Although methods for placement via AR have been reported in the literature, there is a lack of investigations addressing their evaluation. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology to perform a quantitative and qualitative assessment of several AR placement methods and a discussion about their usability in the specific context of AECO. We adopt root mean square error (RMSE) to quantify the placement accuracy of a 3D model and standard deviation to examine its stability (jittering). The results revealed that the AR placement error range is extremely wide (from a few centimeters up to meters). In marker-based methods, the results showed centimeter-range in both indoor and outdoor environments, compared to other methods (Inertial, Marker-less, etc.), while marker-less methods have widely varying error range from centimeters to a few meters. Other commercial solutions based on placement-sensors (GNSS and IMU), such as Trimble SiteVision, have proven placement performance in manual mode with centimeter order, while for the automatic mode, the order of placement and stability is metric, due to the low coverage of RTX (real time extended) in the study area.},

	abstract = {This study into the nature of “the floor” actually began as an open-ended inquiry into sex differences that might occur beyond the sentence level in the multi-party interaction of five informal committee meetings. Technical difficulties prompted the trying out of several different transcription displays, most of which failed to capture the “feel” of the interaction and each of which biased (in its own way) the perception of what had actually gone on. The type of unconventional display eventually used was intended to show the floor holder in the center of the page, flanked by co-occurring talk. Because there were many episodes for which a single floor holder could not be identified, the primary focus of the study shifted to the nature of the floor itself. Questions about sex differences became a secondary and succeeding focus.In the analysis, “floor” and “turn” were distinguished on the basis of “participant-sense” rather than technical criteria. Two kinds of floors were subjectively identified: F1, a singly developed floor; and F2, a collaborative venture where several people seemed to be either operating on the same wavelength or engaging in a free-for-all. The two kinds of floors were differentiated objectively by such features as quantity and frequency participation, language functions, number of nonturn utterances, overlaps, and pauses. There were indeed sex/language differences, but these were related to the type of floor being developed. Men took more and longer turns and did more of the joking, arguing, directing, and soliciting of responses F1 's. Turn length and frequency differences were neutralized in F2's, and certain language functions were used by women to a greater extent in F2's than in F1 's.

As a result, designers have little guidance on which multiplayer game mechanics are most effective. We summarize literature on game design for social closeness into a framework with two collaborative mechanics: cooperation and interdependence. We then created four versions of an online game to independently test the effects of these game mechanics on relationship formation between paired online strangers, showing that cooperation and interdependence are two distinct factors that both can be used to improve play experience and increase social bonds. Additionally, we unpack the effect of interdependence, showing that the improved social closeness can be explained by the increase in conversational turns.},

Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for "quick and dirty" methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation.

The taxonomy builds on the MDA framework and Activity Theory (AT) as top-level attributes, and offers the analytical dimensions WHAT, WHO, WHEN and HOW, each containing a number of sub-categories, for evaluating different levels of collaborative interaction mediated by games. The work is based on a three stage process: design of game instances, data collection, and analysis of play sessions. This taxonomy is an initial step towards capturing the complexity of collaboration mediated by games, and helps in understanding and studying collaboration as a phenomena in game design. Our preliminary work provides a characterization of multiple dimensions of collaborative interaction, providing game designers a starting point for deeper understanding into collaborative interaction mediated by a collocated gameplay.},

Such systems can potentially accommodate large groups of users participating in MR. However, we lack an understanding of how group sizes and interaction methods affect the user experience. In this paper, we aim to advance our understanding of handheld-based MR in the context of multiplayer, co-located games. We conducted a study (N = 38) to understand how user experiences vary by group size (2, 4, and 8) and interaction method (proximity-based or pointing-based). For our experiment, we implemented a multiuser experience for up to ten users. We found that proximity-based interaction that encouraged dynamic movement positively affected social presence and physical/temporal workload. In bigger group settings, participants felt less challenged and less positive. Individuals had varying preferences for group size and interaction type. The findings of the study will advance our understanding of the design space for handheld-based MR in terms of group sizes and interaction schemes. To make our contributions explicit, we conclude our paper with design implications that can inform user experience design in handheld-based mixed reality contexts.},

	title = {Player {Typology} in {Theory} and {Practice}},
	abstract = {Player satisfaction modeling depends in part upon quantitative or qualitative typologies of playing preferences, although such approaches require scrutiny. Examination of psychometric typologies reveal that type theories have—except in rare cases—proven inadequate and have made way for alternative trait theories. This suggests any future player typology that will be sufficiently robust will need foundations in the form of a trait theory of playing preferences. This paper tracks the development of a sequence of player typologies developing from psychometric type theory roots towards an independently validated trait theory of play, albeit one yet to be fully developed. Statistical analysis of the results of one survey in this lineage is presented, along with a discussion of theoretical and practical ways in which the surveys and their implied typological instruments have evolved. INTRODUCTION Categorizing entities based on their common characteristics allows for faster cognitive processing of complex systems, a motivation that underlies psychological typologies, as well as any attempt to classify players according to their playing preferences. This paper discusses a sequence of demographic studies aimed at developing a player typology along lines that parallel psychometric typologies, and considers the theoretical and pragmatic requirements that any such typology must address.},

However, their application to long audio transcription via buffered or sliding window approaches is prone to drifting, hallucination \& repetition; and prohibits batched transcription due to their sequential nature. Further, timestamps corresponding each utterance are prone to inaccuracies and word-level timestamps are not available out-of-the-box. To overcome these challenges, we present WhisperX, a time-accurate speech recognition system with word-level timestamps utilising voice activity detection and forced phoneme alignment. In doing so, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on long-form transcription and word segmentation benchmarks. Additionally, we show that pre-segmenting audio with our proposed VAD Cut \& Merge strategy improves transcription quality and enables a twelve-fold transcription speedup via batched inference.},

	abstract = {To create a great video game, you must start with a solid game design: A well-designed game is easier to build, more entertaining, and has a better chance of succeeding in the marketplace. Here to teach you the essential skills of player-centric game design is one of the industrys leading authorities, who offers a first-hand look into the process, from initial concept to final tuning.Now in its second edition, this updated classic reference by Ernest Adams offers a complete and practical approach to game design, and includes material on concept development, gameplay design, core mechanics, user interfaces, storytelling, and balancing. In an easy-to-follow approach, Adams analyzes the specific design challenges of all the major game genres and shows you how to apply the principles of game design to each one. Youll learn how to:Define the challenges and actions at the heart of the gameplay.Write a high-concept document, a treatment, and a full design script.Understand the essentials of user interface design and how to define a games look and feel.Design for a variety of input mechanisms, including the Wii controller and multi-touch iPhone.Construct a games core mechanics and flow of resources (money, points, ammunition, and more).Develop appealing stories, game characters, and worlds that players will want to visit, including persistent worlds.Work on design problems with engaging end-of-chapter exercises, design worksheets, and case studies.Make your game accessible to broader audiences such as children, adult women, people with disabilities, and casual players. Ernest Adams provides encyclopedic coverage of process and design issues for every aspect of game design, expressed as practical lessons that can be immediately applied to a design in-progress. He offers the best framework Ive seen for thinking about the relationships between core mechanics, gameplay, and playerone that Ive found useful for both teaching and research.

design between VR and smartphones. The game is based on one person
using a VR system to play, while a co-player in the same room uses a
smartphone. For research, online sources and scientific papers are used as
well as analogue and digital games. These are analyzed in terms of general
mechanics and interaction between the co-players and adapted to the game
concept. This Thesis aims at showing the aspects of the current state of

In this paper, we consider the problem of procedurally generating a quest, defined as a series of actions required to progress towards a goal, in a text-adventure game. Quest generation in text environments is challenging because they must be semantically coherent. We present and evaluate two quest generation techniques: (1) a Markov model, and (2) a neural generative model. We specifically look at generating quests about cooking and train our models on recipe data. We evaluate our techniques with human participant studies looking at perceived creativity and coherence.},

Mixed methods were the most frequent research tool utilized by researchers. Limitations of current research include the preponderance of small-scale experimental studies that investigated only a limited number of factors. Although the research is not conclusive, findings indicate that game play facilitates collaboration, the production of target language output, vocabulary learning, and reduces the influence of factors that inhibit learning. This chapter concludes by identifying promising areas for future research.},

Activities in video games can be a hobby or to fill your spare time. Games can be media education that contain learning orientation, skills and cooperation. Video games can also affect the behavior of special players and the environment in general. One type of video games that provides it, is adventure video games which are the result of combining survival methods for specific purposes that contain knowledge of the surrounding environment and skills in exploiting opportunities. The main player character is often presented in video games in the form of problem solving and thinking ability in complete the adventure or the game itself based on the character for the purpose of learning about characters that are strengthened with certain skills. Video games with the main character elements in them can reflect the discovery of new ideas, approval of ideas, completion of skills or reconfiguring ideas, so playing an adventure video game can lead to positive values that influence players' thought also motivate them to complete adventure challenges. In this study, we want to know the effect of adventure video games on the development of student’s character and behavior. From the calculation of the Wilcoxon test it can be concluded that; (1) adventure video games influence the development of student character (2) Adventure video games influence the development of student behavior.},

We observe for general symmetric multiplayer games, with players 2-n in coalition against player 1, that there are three values, corresponding to symmetric Nash equilibrium, optimal asynchronous, and optimal synchronous strategies, in that order, for which inequalities may for different examples be strict or nonstrict (i.e., equality) in any combination. Different from Nash equilibria and synchronous optima, which may be phrased as convex optimization problems, or classical 2-player games, determination of asynchronous optima is a nonconvex optimization problem. We discuss methods of numerical approximation of this optimum, and examine performance on 3-player rock-paper-scissors and discretized Guts poker. Finally, we present sufficient conditions guaranteeing different possibilities for behavior, based on concave/convexity properties of the payoff function. These answer in the affirmative the open problem posed by Buck-Lee-Platnick-Wheeler-Zumbrun whether the optimal asynchronous coalition value for 3-player guts is equal to the Nash equilibrium value zero. At the same time, we present a number of new results regarding synchronous coalition play for continuous \$3\$-player guts.},

However it must be overcome some technical obstacle to realize its true power. One of the problems is interaction in handheld AR environment. Touch screen interaction is one of the common interaction methods in handheld AR but it is not easy to interact in touch screen with virtual object in handheld AR scene. Current research shows that Freeze Interaction technique shows its usefulness in handheld touch screen AR interaction. However it has a drawback such as, when users freeze their view it freezes the whole scene. When virtual object are updating continuously the real world-view is not being updated and remains as still picture. It can be a problem when users need to deal with current up-to date real world scene. To overcome current problem of Freeze Interaction technique we have implemented new freeze technique ‘Freeze-Object’ for more precise interaction.

A crucial aspect of this process is the accurate positioning of AR content within the physical environment, which requires effective AR interaction techniques that enable full 3D manipulation of AR elements. In this study, we conducted an experimental comparison of three different AR interaction techniques with 55 participants to empirically assess their performance, workload, and user satisfaction across tasks related to AR instruction development.

	abstract = {The use of Augmented Reality (AR) devices for surgical guidance has gained increasing traction in the medical field. Traditional registration methods often rely on external fiducial markers to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance. However, these markers introduce cumbersome calibration procedures and can be challenging to deploy in clinical settings. While commercial solutions have attempted real-time markerless tracking using the native RGB cameras of AR devices, their accuracy remains questionable for medical guidance, primarily due to occlusions and significant outliers between the live sensor data and the preoperative target anatomy point cloud derived from MRI or CT scans. In this work, we present a markerless framework that relies only on the depth sensor of AR devices and consists of two modules: a registration module for high-precision, outlier-robust target anatomy localization, and a tracking module for real-time pose estimation. The registration module integrates depth sensor error correction, a human-in-the-loop region filtering technique, and a robust global alignment with curvature-aware feature sampling, followed by local ICP refinement, for markerless alignment of preoperative models with patient anatomy. The tracking module employs a fast and robust registration algorithm that uses the initial pose from the registration module to estimate the target pose in real-time. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of both modules through simulation and real-world measurements. The results indicate that our markerless system achieves superior performance for registration and comparable performance for tracking to industrial solutions. The two-module design makes our system a one-stop solution for surgical procedures where the target anatomy moves or stays static during surgery.},

	abstract = {Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is an essential component of modern Augmented Reality (AR) applications. However, VIO only tracks the relative pose of the device, leading to drift over time. Absolute pose estimation methods infer the device's absolute pose, but their accuracy depends on the input quality. This paper introduces VIO-APR, a new framework for markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. VIO-APR uses VIO to assess the reliability of the APR and the APR to identify and compensate for VIO drift. This feedback loop results in more accurate positioning and more stable AR experiences. To evaluate VIO-APR, we created a dataset that combines camera images with ARKit's VIO system output for six indoor and outdoor scenes of various scales. Over this dataset, VIO-APR improves the median accuracy of popular APR by up to 36{\textbackslash}\% in position and 29{\textbackslash}\% in orientation, increases the percentage of frames in the high (\$0.25 m, 2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$) accuracy level by up to 112{\textbackslash}\% and reduces the percentage of frames predicted below the low (\$5 m, 10{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$) accuracy greatly. We implement VIO-APR into a mobile AR application using Unity to demonstrate its capabilities. VIO-APR results in noticeably more accurate localization and a more stable overall experience.},

	abstract = {Most existing augmented reality (AR) applications are suitable for cases in which only a small number of real world entities are involved, such as superimposing a character on a single surface. In this case, we only need to calculate pose of the camera relative to that surface. However, when an AR health or environmental application involves a one-to-one relationship between an entity in the real-world and the corresponding object in the computer model (geo-referenced object), we need to estimate the pose of the camera in reference to a common coordinate system for better geo-referenced object registration in the real-world. New innovations in developing cheap sensors, computer vision techniques, machine learning, and computing power have helped to develop applications with more precise matching between a real world and a virtual content. AR Tracking techniques can be divided into two subcategories: marker-based and marker-less approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of marker-less registration and tracking techniques and reviews their most important categories in the context of ubiquitous Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and AR focusing to health and environmental applications. Basic ideas, advantages, and disadvantages, as well as challenges, are discussed for each subcategory of tracking and registration techniques. We need precise enough virtual models of the environment for both calibrations of tracking and visualization. Ubiquitous GISs can play an important role in developing AR in terms of providing seamless and precise spatial data for outdoor (e.g., environmental applications) and indoor (e.g., health applications) environments.},

We use different gestures for manipulation and achieve 7 DOF (3 DOF each for translation and rotation, and 1 DOF for scaling). The proposed framework, called GHAR, is implemented for architectural building models. It augments virtual CAD models of buildings on the ground, enabling users to manipulate and visualize an architectural model before actual construction. The system offers a quick view of the building infrastructure, playing a vital role in requirement analysis and planning in construction technology. We evaluated the usability, manipulability, and comprehensibility of the proposed system using a standard user study with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Handheld Augmented Reality User Study (HARUS). We compared our GeoPose-based markerless HAR framework with a marker-based HAR framework, finding significant improvement in the aforementioned three parameters with the markerless framework.},

As a result, we can augment different virtual contents according to the corresponding page. For this purpose, we use a multi-core programming approach that separates the page recognition module from the tracking module. In the page recognition module, highly distinctive Scale Invariant Features Transform (SIFT) features are used. In the tracking module, a coarse-to-fine approach is exploited for fast frame-to-frame matching. Our tracker provides more than 30 frames per second. In addition to the tracker, we explain multi-layer based data structure for maintaining the AR book. A GUI-based authoring tool is also shown to validate feasibility of the tracker and data structures.

They were also adapted to use fixed point math, with the purpose of improving the overall performance of the routines. The port of these libraries opens up the possibility of having other computer vision tasks being executed on mobile platforms. A model based tracking approach that relies on edge information was adopted. Since it does not require a high processing power, it is suitable for constrained devices such as handhelds.

We have previously developed a “marker-based” AR app (ARchemy) for Android devices to help students visualize molecular structures in 3D. Using recent technological advancements, to avoid the limitation of using a printed marker, we have successfully developed a simple and low-cost “markerless” AR app, which can be used for both Android and iOS devices. Students who used the AR app saw a significant increase in understanding of the complexity of molecular structures compared to those who used traditional molecular modeling kits.

In this study, we considered how game goal structure – competition or cooperation – and relationships between players – friend or stranger – affect aggression and cooperative behaviors. Compared with competition, cooperative play resulted in significantly more cooperative behaviors in a modified Prisoner’s Dilemma task. However, neither competitive nor cooperative goal structures significantly increased state hostility, suggesting that altering players’ gaming goals (e.g. competition or cooperation) may not be enough to elicit strong affective aggression. Additionally, cooperative game play was found to predict increased cooperative behaviors and trust in their partner. Implications of the findings are discussed.},

In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a "video see through" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. Here, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking.},

The stereo from motion method is utilized to compute the 3D position of natural features, while the position of the camera is computed from the artificial markers placed in the working space. Therefore the map is build in the fixed frame of reference frame provided by artificial markers. When the whole working space is mapped, artificial markers are not required for the functionality of the augmented reality system. The actually seen natural features are compared to those stored in the map and camera pose is estimated according found correspondences. The main advantages are that no artificial markers are necessary during regular use of the system, and that method does not rely on the tracking. Even the single frame is sufficient to compute the pose of camera and visualize the robot’s plan. As there is a big number of natural features in the environment, the precision of the camera pose estimation is sufficient, when the camera is looking into the mapped working space.},

This evaluation allowed also to understand the applicability limits of texture based approaches in the textureless automotive environment, a problem not addressed frequently in the literature. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work addressing the analysis of a complete tracking system for augmented reality focused on the automotive sector which could be tested and validated in a major benchmark like the Volkswagen/ISMAR Tracking Challenge, providing useful insights on the development of such expert and intelligent systems.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen significant improvement in absolute camera pose estimation, paving the way for pervasive markerless Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurate absolute pose estimation techniques are computation- and storage-heavy, requiring computation offloading. As such, AR systems rely on visual-inertial odometry (VIO) to track the device's relative pose between requests to the server. However, VIO suffers from drift, requiring frequent absolute repositioning. This paper introduces MobileARLoc, a new framework for on-device large-scale markerless mobile AR that combines an absolute pose regressor (APR) with a local VIO tracking system. Absolute pose regressors (APRs) provide fast on-device pose estimation at the cost of reduced accuracy. To address APR accuracy and reduce VIO drift, MobileARLoc creates a feedback loop where VIO pose estimations refine the APR predictions. The VIO system identifies reliable predictions of APR, which are then used to compensate for the VIO drift. We comprehensively evaluate MobileARLoc through dataset simulations. MobileARLoc halves the error compared to the underlying APR and achieve fast (80{\textbackslash},ms) on-device inference speed.},

A patient mesh in the real coordinate system is acquired through a patient 3D scan using a depth sensor for registration. The patient mesh on the virtual coordinate system is obtained by contrast-based skin segmentation in 3D mesh generated from breast CT scans. Then, the nipple area is detected based on the gradient in the segmented skin area. The region of interest (ROI) is set based on the detection result to select the vertices in the virtual coordinate system. The mesh on the real and virtual coordinate systems is first aligned by matching the center of mass, and the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method is applied to perform more precise registration. Experimental results of 20 patients' data showed 98.35 ± 0.71\% skin segmentation accuracy in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) value, 2.79 ± 1.54 mm nipple detection error, and 4.69 ± 1.95 mm registration error. Experiments using phantom and patient data also confirmed high accuracy in AR visualization. The proposed method in this study showed that the 3D AR visualization of medical data on the patient's body is possible by using a single depth sensor without having to use markers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the use of an augmented reality navigation system that provides a markerless registration system using stereo vision in oral and maxillofacial surgery.
METHOD: A feasibility study was performed on a subject, wherein a stereo camera was used for tracking and markerless registration. The computed tomography data obtained from the volunteer was used to create an integral videography image and a 3-dimensional rapid prototype model of the jaw. The overlay of the subject's anatomic site and its 3D-IV image were displayed in real space using a 3D-AR display. Extraction of characteristic points and teeth matching were done using parallax images from two stereo cameras for patient-image registration.
RESULTS: Accurate registration of the volunteer's anatomy with IV stereoscopic images via image matching was done using the fully automated markerless system, which recognized the incisal edges of the teeth and captured information pertaining to their position with an average target registration error of {\textless} 1 mm. These 3D-CT images were then displayed in real space with high accuracy using AR. Even when the viewing position was changed, the 3D images could be observed as if they were floating in real space without using special glasses.
CONCLUSION: Teeth were successfully used for registration via 3D image (contour) matching. This system, without using references or fiducial markers, displayed 3D-CT images in real space with high accuracy. The system provided real-time markerless registration and 3D image matching via stereo vision, which, combined with AR, could have significant clinical applications.},

Moreover, the visualization of medical data on a 2D screen during surgery is undesirable, because it requires a surgeon to continuously switch focus. This switching focus problem also results in extensive use of intraoperative radiation to gain additional insights for a 3D configuration. The use of augmented reality (AR) has the potential to overcome these problems, for instance by using markers on target points that are aligned with the AR solution. However, placing markers for a precise virtual overlay are time-costly, always have to be visible within the field of view and disrupt the surgical workflow. In this study, we developed ARCUS, a depth-based, markerless AR navigation system, which overlays 3D virtual elements onto target body parts to overcome the limitations of 2D medical visualization techniques.},

Der Beitrag schildert und interpretiert einige Ereignisse aus der Entwicklungsgeschichte der von Claude E. Shannon „Mathematische Theorie der Kommunikation“ genannten Informationstheorie, die zeitgleich auch von Norbert Wiener entwickelt wurde, sowie der Informatik (Computer Science) als eine in den 1950er- und 1960er-Jahren entstehende neue Universitätsdisziplin und der von Lotfi A. Zadeh 1965 eingeführten mathematischen Theorie der Fuzzy Sets als wegweisende historische Prozesse, die im „Digital Turn“ mündeten. Shannon, Wiener, aber auch Warren Weaver und etwas später Zadeh wiesen auf folgendes „Fundamentalproblem der Kommunikation“ hin: Möglicherweise wird die gesendete Nachricht nicht als exakte Kopie empfangen. Dieses Problem fungierte als eine der „Wurzeln“, die zur Begründung der Fuzzy Set Theorie führten. Die Entstehung dieser mathematischen Theorie ging zeitlich mit der Ausdifferenzierung des Fachs Informatik (Computer Sciences) aus der Elektrotechnik (Electrical Engineeering) einher und auch diese Entwicklung wurde von Zadeh aktiv mitgestaltet. Insbesondere interpretierte Zadeh wissenschaftliche Disziplinen am Beispiel der Elektrotechnik und der Informatik als Fuzzy Sets, deren Fachgebiete er nicht als scharf voneinander abgrenzbare sondern als unscharfe Teilbereiche ansah.},

First they are discussing the dynamics (specifically the role of feedback) of interpersonal communication. Second they are exemplifying a model which, as they themselves point out, ‘is clearly better suited to the description of face-to-face interaction than to the more remote processes of the mass media’. But this is to stop short of both the extent and the implications of their arguments. The passage just quoted continues ‘but remnants of the same psychological interaction can still be seen in more distant communication’ and then makes its further point explicitly: ‘while I am looking at a photograph, painting or film, I am interpreting it and formulating some kind of response’. What quickly becomes apparent is the capacity of models to embody arguments about what communication is (and is not). Osgood and Schramm’s model may rather more straightforwardly describe conversations between people. It can also go some way to address those essential negotiations that go on between texts and their readers.

                                 Do I like this person?
                              
                              
                                 How does this fit in to what I already know?
                              
                              
                                 What am I going to say when it comes to my turn?
                              
                           
                        
                        When two people are engaged in a conversation, they respond continually to each other’s statements: while I recite my tale of woe, you will make regular brief responses, either through changes in your facial expression or through interjections: ‘Uh-huh, oh really, well I never, oh your poor thing, that’s terrible.’ Without this kind of feedback, my flow of words will probably dry up; I need to have confirmation that you are still listening and that you understand what I am saying.
                        
                           There is a well established technique in television and radio whereby the interviewer nods encouragingly at the interviewee in order to prevent any hesitation in the flow of words. Even in a television interview which has taken place in the street or in someone’s home, the face of the interviewer will appear from time to time asking questions or nodding encouragement; and yet the economics of television are such that only one camera will have been used. These shots are filmed after the interview and are skilfully edited into the final version to suggest a continuous event. Many of these inserts are of the journalist’s head nodding: the effect on the viewer at home is that the veracity of the interviewee’s statements is supported by the nodding head of the supposedly impartial interviewer.
                        Anticipated or actual feedback is an essential factor in the psychology of communication, and one which plays an essential part in Osgood and Schramm’s (1954) model:

                              https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" content-type="black-white" xlink:href="https://s3-euw1-ap-pe-df-pch-content-public-p.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/9781315015675/226b3f40-5b37-44b5-af78-bdb6d3feb3fe/content/fig12\_1\_B.tif"/{\textgreater}
                           
                        
                        As a representation of interpersonal communication, this has a number of advantages over the account of Shannon and Weaver. First, it makes feedback a central feature of the process, rather than an optional extra added onto a one-directional basic frame-work. Second, it is a dynamic model: it helps to show how a situation can change. In addition, it shows graphically why redundancy is an essential part of the process: since the participants are interpreting each other’s signals while they encode their own, they need some spare capacity in the system to leave space for this interpretation to function. Both ‘sender’ and ‘receiver’ are modifying their intentions at every point in the exchange.
                        This model is clearly better suited to the description of face-to-face interaction than to the more remote processes of the mass media, but remnants of the same psychological interaction can still be seen in more distant communication: while I am looking at a photograph, painting or film, I am interpreting it and formulating some kind of response, which may be expressed to a companion or completely internalized to form an element in a later communication of my own. Behaviourist psychologists such as Vygotsky have referred to the thought process as ‘internalized dialogue’, a concept which relates closely to Osgood and Schramm’s model. They suggest that young children’s thinking grows out of the dialogues which they hold with adults. Problems are solved by an exchange of question, answer and instruction. As time passes, you can hear a child continuing the dialogue in the absence of the adult, but playing both roles. Later the dialogue becomes silent, but is still taking place inside the child’s head. Photographers, painters and film-makers, as they plan their compositions, will try to anticipate the interpretative processes of their ultimate audience: this, too, may take the form of an ‘internalized’ dialogue’, where production and anticipated interpretation interact with each other to stimulate the creative process.
                        For both sender and receiver, feedback is vital. Without it, the sender cannot be sure if the message has even been received, still less whether it has been greeted with disagreement, disbelief, misunderstanding or bored complacency. There is no way of knowing which points to labour, nor which are likely to be key issues for future development. For the receiver, on the other hand, feedback is the means by which dialogue can focus on more fruitful areas and skip less interesting matters.

	abstract = {Recently, the field of strategic communication has been criticized for lacking a coherent theoretical synthesis. Recognizing that strategic communication is a sub-discipline of communication science, we study how the field is anchored in the corpus of established communication theories – including social science, interpretative, and critical approaches. To describe the use, development, and context of communication theories in strategic communication publications, we analyzed all articles published in ten public relations/ corporate communication/ organizational communication/ strategic communication journals over twenty years (N = 4,027). While the vast majority of articles did not refer to one of the 91 communication theories, the share of references to these theories has been increasing. Overall, we found a high diversity of approaches – with considerable differences among journals – indicating a broad discourse. However, we also found a growing relevance of the social science paradigm. We argue that a stronger focus on communication theories may facilitate a consilient synthesis and increase the relevance of the field, academically and practically. We therefore propose to strengthen the communication science perspective in strategic communication.},

Handlungsrahmen computervermittelter Kommunikation beschrieben werden können.

Der ehemalige Bundeskanzler Gerhard Schröder wurde danach gelegentlich kritisiert, Familienpolitik als „Gedöns“ abgetan zu haben – ganz im Gegensatz zur neuen Familienministerin Ursula von der Leyen. Familienpolitik, so stellten Kommentatoren fest, rückte nun stärker ins Zentrum der Politik. Damit wurde auch deutlich, dass „die Familie“ weiterhin eine zentrale Bedeutung hat. Auch Familien- oder Kinderlosigkeit wird inzwischen nicht mehr in erster Linie als Ausdruck von Freiheit, Selbstverwirklichung oder Emanzipation betrachtet, sondern als demographisches, soziales und kulturelles Problem. Nicht nur das ganze Sozialversicherungssystem drohe deswegen zusammenzubrechen; auch die Reproduktion der Elite sei gefährdet, wenn insbesondere immer mehr Akademikerpaare auf Familiengründung verzichteten.},

The ways of conceiving the process of media-communication have changed along with the evolution of the theoretical paradigms of psychology and the social sciences. The main limits of these models which were first developed in the area of media studies derive, on the one hand, from the rigid alternating between source and receivers, and, on the other hand, from the lack of integration of the social variables in the conceptualization of the communication process. This paper will show how an increased focus on the interactive aspects of communication leads to the replacement of traditional linear models with more complex models implying a redefining of the concept of communication, as, for example, the dialogical models and the discursive approach. It is in this perspective that the media is seen to have a fundamental role in the processes of constructing/reconstructing reality, and the development of qualitative methodologies is especially needed.Este artículo intenta proporcionar una visión general sobre la oposición entre los modelos lineales tradicionales y los enfoques discursivos en el estudio de los procesos de los medios de comunicación de masas. Las maneras de concebir tales procesos han cambiado con la evolución de los paradigmas teóricos de la psicología y de las ciencias sociales. Las principales limitaciones de éstos modelos, que fueron primero desarrollados en el área de los estudios de los medios, provienen, por un lado, de la rígida alternancia entre fuente y receptores, y, por el otro, de la falta de integración de las variables sociales en la conceptualización de los procesos de comunicación. Este artículo muestra cómo un creciente interés en los aspectos interactivos de la comunicación, conduce a la sustitución de los modelos lineales tradicionales por modelos más complejos implicando una redefinición del concepto de comunicación; como por ejemplo, en los modelos dialógicos y el enfoque discursivo. Es en esta perspectiva que se ve el papel fundamental de los medios en los procesos de construcción y reconstrucción de la realidad, para lo cual es especialmente necesario el desarrollo de metodología cualitativas.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) has gained enormous popularity and acceptance in the past few years. AR is indeed a combination of different immersive experiences and solutions that serve as integrated components to assemble and accelerate the augmented reality phenomena as a workable and marvelous adaptive solution for many realms. These solutions of AR include tracking as a means for keeping track of the point of reference to make virtual objects visible in a real scene. Similarly, display technologies combine the virtual and real world with the user’s eye. Authoring tools provide platforms to develop AR applications by providing access to low-level libraries. The libraries can thereafter interact with the hardware of tracking sensors, cameras, and other technologies. In addition to this, advances in distributed computing and collaborative augmented reality also need stable solutions. The various participants can collaborate in an AR setting. The authors of this research have explored many solutions in this regard and present a comprehensive review to aid in doing research and improving different business transformations. However, during the course of this study, we identified that there is a lack of security solutions in various areas of collaborative AR (CAR), specifically in the area of distributed trust management in CAR. This research study also proposed a trusted CAR architecture with a use-case of tourism that can be used as a model for researchers with an interest in making secure AR-based remote communication sessions.},

	abstract = {In recent years Augmented Reality (AR) has become more and more popular, especially since the availability of mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets, brought AR into our everyday life. Although the AR community has not yet agreed on a formal definition of AR, some work focused on proposing classifications of existing AR methods or applications. Such applications cover a wide variety of technologies, devices and goals, consequently existing taxonomies rely on multiple classification criteria that try to take into account AR applications diversity. In this paper we review existing taxonomies of augmented reality applications and we propose our own, which is based on (1) the number of degrees of freedom required by the tracking of the application, as well as on (2) the visualization mode used, (3) the temporal base of the displayed content and (4) the rendering modalities used in the application. Our taxonomy covers location-based services as well as more traditional vision-based AR applications. Although AR is mainly based on the visual sense, other rendering modalities are also covered by the same degree-of-freedom criterion in our classification.},

Studies show positive effects, like increased motivation and improved concept connections, but there is a lack of consistency in the implementation and investigation of AR in science experiments. This review examines AR usage, criteria, design parameters for the development of AR applications and the validation methods, taking into account the PRISMA guidelines. A Web of Science database search using “Publish or Perish” software (version 23.4.0) identified 247 potentially relevant articles from 2000 to March 2024 in international, peer-reviewed journals. After removing duplicates, inaccessible abstracts, and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 40 studies were selected for in-depth analysis. Physics had the most AR applications, primarily for visualizing invisible properties. Most studies used quantitative or qualitative methods, only a few used both or did not conduct empirical research. Research questions varied, but common drawbacks included small sample sizes and low use of AR design parameters such as interactivity, adaptivity, realistic representation and use of game elements. This review identifies opportunities for improvement in the implementation and investigation of AR in science education experiments and emphasizes consistent and rigorous approaches to fully exploit the benefits of AR in science education.},

	abstract = {The think-aloud method is a widely used method for evaluating the usability of websites and software. However, it can also be used with cartographic products, an area which has been neglected up to now. It is a method in which test participants verbalise all their thought processes aloud. The participants are given a test scenario containing tasks to be completed. The method aims to reveal the participants’ subjective attitudes toward a product in order to evaluate its usability. The present paper describes the use of the think-aloud method to evaluate the usability of a cartographic work—the regional atlas of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The study includes (I) a complete review of the method, based on the studies conducted; (II) testing tools for working with recorded data; (III) designing an experiment for evaluating the usability of the atlas; and (IV) the resulting qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the atlas based on the obtained results. During the study, three approaches were proposed to process and analyse the audio recordings. The first option was to separate the audio recordings into individual annotations and analyse them. The second option was to convert the recordings to text and perform a linguistic analysis. The third supplementary option was to use all the material produced and to analyse it subjectively and retrospectively, from the researcher’s perspective. All three options were used in the final assessment of the atlas. Based on the participants’ statements, any shortcomings in the studied atlas were identified for each topic (e.g., non-dominant maps or exceedingly complex infographics), and recommendations for their elimination were proposed.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Loneliness is inherently linked to social connections, with interpersonal communication playing a pivotal role. Despite this connection, limited research exists on the relationship between loneliness and communication among young adults. This study investigates the correlation between face-to-face, telephone, and online communication frequencies and loneliness among individuals in their 20s. (2) Methods: Using a dataset from a nationwide survey conducted by the Japanese Cabinet Office, this study focuses on 1812 respondents aged 20–30, selected from a random sample of 20,000 individuals aged 16 and older across Japan. (3) Results: A Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis reveals a significant association between communication frequency and loneliness, even after adjusting for demographic characteristics. Notably, decreased communication frequency across all modalities correlated with increased loneliness. Online communication exhibited the highest impact, followed by face-to-face communication, with phone call communication ranking last. (4) Conclusions: This study emphasizes the importance of seamlessly integrating social networking service (SNS)-based communication with various forms of social interaction. A well-balanced integration of these approaches is crucial for mitigating loneliness among young individuals and promoting positive mental health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and, more generally, social fears are common in young people. Although avoidance behaviors are known to be an important maintaining factor of social anxiety, little is known about the severity and occurrence of avoidance behaviors in young people from the general population, hampering approaches for early identification and intervention. Symptoms, syndromes, and diagnoses of DSM-5 mental disorders including SAD were assessed in a random population-based sample of 14-21-year-olds (n = 1,180) from Dresden, Germany, in 2015/2016 using a standardized diagnostic interview (DIA-X-5/D-CIDI). An adapted version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale was used to ascertain the extent of social fears and avoidance. Diagnostic criteria for lifetime SAD were met by n = 82 participants, resulting in a weighted lifetime prevalence of 6.6\%. Social anxiety was predominantly reported for test situations and when speaking or performing in front of others. Avoidance was most prevalent in the latter situations. On average, anxiety and avoidance first occurred at ages 11 and 12, respectively, with avoidance occurring in most cases either at about the same age as anxiety or slightly later. In the total sample, lifetime prevalence for most DSM-5 disorders increased with the severity of social anxiety and avoidance. Results underline the need for preventive or early intervention efforts especially regarding test anxiety and fear and avoidance of speaking in front of others. These situations are particularly relevant in youth. Avoidance behaviors may also be discussed as diagnostic marker for early case identification.},

	abstract = {We present ARctic Escape, a co-located augmented reality (AR) escape room designed to promote collaboration between dyads through play. While physical escape rooms provide groups with fun, social experiences, they require a gameplay venue, props, and a game master, all of which detract from their ease of access. Existing AR escape rooms demonstrate that AR can make escape room experiences easier to access. Still, many AR escape rooms are single-player and therefore fail to maintain the social and collaborative elements of their physical counterparts. This paper presents ARctic Escape, a two-person AR escape room with clues emphasizing player interaction and teamwork. We evaluated ARctic Escape by conducting semi-structured interviews with four dyads to learn about participants' interpersonal dynamics and experiences during gameplay. We found that participants thought the experience was fun, collaborative, promoted discussion, and inspired new social dynamics, but sometimes the escape room's reliance on virtual content was disorienting.},

It follows the Harvard Case study method, where the reader is placed in the role of the decision-maker in a real-life professional situation. In this book, the reader is asked to perform analysis of dozens of UCD work situations and propose solutions for the problem set. The problems posed in the cases cover a wide variety of key tasks and issues facing practitioners today, including those that are related to organizational/managerial topics, UCD methods and processes, and technical/ project issues. The benefit of the casebook and its organization is that it offers the new practitioner (as well as experienced practitioners working in new settings) the valuable practice in decision-making that one cannot get by reading a book or attending a seminar. *The first User-Centered Design Casebook, with cases covering the key tasks and issues facing UCD practitioners today. *Each chapter based on real world cases with complex problems, giving readers as close to a real-world experience as possible. * Offers "the things you don't learn in school," such as innovative and hybrid solutions that were actually used on the problems discussed.},

In the present work, we address this interesting topic from the perspective of simple games, involving two teams playing according to a small set of simple rules, taking the place of four types of complex networks. Starting from a minimalist game, characterized by full symmetry always leading to ties, four other games are described in progressive order of complexity, taking into account the presence of neighbors as well as strategies. Each of these five games, as well as their specific changes when implemented in four types of networks, are studied in terms of statistics of the total duration of the game as well as the number of victories and ties, with several interesting results that substantiate the importance of the network topology on the respective dynamics. As a subsidiary result, the visualization of relationships between the data elements in terms of coincidence similarity networks allowed a more complete and direct interpretation of the obtained results.},

Research on this subject have been made for military simulations, virtual reality systems, computer support teamwork, the solutions diverge on the problems posed by MCG. With this in mind, this document provides an overview of the four issues affecting networking at the MCG. First, network resources (bandwidth, latency and computing capacity), together with the technical limits within which the MCG must operate. Second, the distribution concepts include communication architectures (peer-to-peer, client / server, server / network), and data and control architectures (centralized, distributed and reproduced) .Thirdly, scalability allows the MCG to adapt to changes in parameterization resources. Finally, security is intended to fend off the traps and vandalism, which are common in online games; to check traffic, particularly these games we decided to take the massively multiplayer game League of Legends, a scene corresponding to a situation of real life in a network of ADSL access network is deployed has been simulated by using NS2

Three variants of TCP, it means SACK TCP, New Reno TCP, and TCP Vegas, have been considered for the cross traffic. The results show that TCP Vegas is able to maintain a constant speed while racing against the game traffic, since it avoids the packet loss and the delays in the tail caused by high peaks, without increasing the size of the sender window. SACK TCP and TCP New Reno, on the other hand, tend to increase continuously the sender window size, which could allow a greater loss of packages and also to cause unwanted delays for the game traffic.},

The cooperative goal structure was found to lead to greater effort put into the game than the competitive goal structure. In addition, playing with friends resulted in a stronger commitment to the in-game goals than playing with strangers in the cooperative goal structure context, yet no difference was found between playing with friends and playing with strangers with regard to goal commitment in the competitive goal structure context. A moderated mediation relationship was found among the variables. Theoretical contributions to the current literature on goal structure and motivation, practical implications for exergame design, and directions for future research are discussed.},

Another aim was to compare students’ game attitudes, feelings towards group work, and achievements in cooperative versus collaborative digital game-based learning environments. One hundred sixtyfour, sixth grade students from five different classrooms at an elementary school in South Korea participated voluntarily in this study. A total of two boys and two girls were randomly assigned to each group resulting in twenty groups for each of the grouping conditions. Based on interaction effects, results suggest that male students show more positive games attitudes in collaborative conditions, whereas female students show more positive game attitudes in cooperative conditions. Data also suggest that males show more positive feelings towards group work than females, irrespective of grouping conditions. Regarding academic and gaming achievements, female students showed higher academic achievement in collaborative conditions while male students scored higher on academic achievement under cooperative conditions. Findings from this study indicate that gender-balanced groups show significantly higher gaming achievement in collaboration compared to cooperation. Results are interpreted with reference to future research and classroom practices.},

The two versions of the game had exactly the same information, where in the collaborative game the information was divided between the two players in an asymmetrical format, where one player is outside of VR. The evaluation of the two versions compared only the experience of the participants in VR using an independent measures design. The results showed that the two-player version scored higher in questions related to positive game experience with a significant difference to the single player version. Furthermore, participants using the two-player version rated significantly lower on questions related to annoyance.

The model presents seven different archetypes of players: Seeker, Survivor, Daredevil, Mastermind, Conqueror, Socialiser, and Achiever. We explain how each of these player archetypes relates to older player typologies (such as Myers-Briggs), and how each archetype characterizes a specific playing style. We conducted a survey among more than 50,000 players using the BrainHex model as a personality type motivator to gather and compare demographic data to the different BrainHex archetypes. We discuss some results from this survey with a focus on psychometric orientation of respondents, to establish relationships between personality types and BrainHex archetypes.},

To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test–retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures.},

We provide correlations between the scale scores and latent factors, and compare each measure’s pattern of correlations with measures of other individual difference constructs.

	abstract = {Location-aware Augmented Reality (AR) applications are often argued to provide users with immersive experiences that are situated in the real world. Immersion, which can be seen as a form of cognitive and emotional absorption, has been asserted to promote enjoyment, engagement in a task and even learning. However, such claims remain largely unsubstantiated due to the lack of validated instruments for measuring users’ immersion in location-based AR environments. Attempts to develop validated instruments for evaluating immersion have been few and non-systematic, while existing instruments are oriented towards measuring immersion in the context of non-AR digital games. At the same time, studies seeking to operationalize and measure immersion are still inconclusive; even though immersion is considered as a multi-level psychological construct, it is not yet clear whether there is multidimensionality in each level or not. The present study describes the development and validation of the ARI [Augmented Reality Immersion] questionnaire: an instrument for measuring immersion in AR location-aware settings. To achieve this goal, a multi-step process was employed to develop and validate a novel instrument; analyses included exploratory factor analysis with 202 high school students, followed by a confirmatory factor analysis with 162 high school students. This multi-step process resulted in a 21-item, seven-point Likert-type instrument with satisfactory construct validity, which is based on a multi-leveled model of immersion with multidimensionality in each level. We argue that the ARI questionnaire, as a validated and tested measurement, can be highly useful for researchers and designers in the field of location-based AR.},

	abstract = {Emotions displayed by others are pivotal ingredients of the decisions we make in social contexts. However, most of the research to date has focused on the subjective emotion of the decider rather than on the emotional expressions of the partners in the interaction. The present investigation was designed to explore how happy and angry facial expressions modulate cooperative responses in multi-round Trust Games. Our results show that happy partners generate higher levels of trust than angry partners even after repeated experience in a context in which emotional displays are not predictive of the partners' cooperation rates. This effect disappears once the social meaning of emotional displays is removed from the game. An additional study shows that participants are able to learn specific associations between discrete emotions and positive or negative cooperative tendencies, although they need more evidence when the associations counteract prior expectations. Overall, our results stress the reliability of discrete emotions as cues in interpersonal interactions and the resilience of the effect of these positive and negative cues in contexts in which they lack real predictive power.},

Client trust is investigated also as a multidimensional construct with credibility trust and benevolence trust being the two dimensions used. Closeness is investigated as a unidimensional construct. The results suggest that there is a 'positive relationship between communications clarity and credibility trust and closeness; social communications and benevolence trust and closeness. These findings would be beneficial for SME professional services providers, as it would allow them to develop focused interpersonal communications strategies to enhance their clients' perceptions of the trust and closeness. Increased client perception of trust and closeness is beneficial as it leads to increased referrals and positive word-of-mouth recommendations and mutually beneficial long-term relationships},

The concurrent validity of the scales was largely supported. All scales were higher in the face-to-face than mediated interactions. As predicted the co-presence, and two of the three psychological involvement factors, mutual attention and mutual understanding, were significantly different in the face-to-face interaction. There was not any significant different in empathy. Among the three behavioral engagement scales, mutual assistance scale was significant. Reliabilities were satisfactory with an average of ? =.77. The pilot provides preliminary support for the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of the Networked Minds measure of social presence.},

In this experiment, we compare reports of affective experience obtained using SAM, which requires only three simple judgments, to the Semantic Differential scale devised by Mehrabian and Russell (An approach to environmental psychology, 1974) which requires 18 different ratings. Subjective reports were measured to a series of pictures that varied in both affective valence and intensity. Correlations across the two rating methods were high both for reports of experienced pleasure and felt arousal. Differences obtained in the dominance dimension of the two instruments suggest that SAM may better track the personal response to an affective stimulus. SAM is an inexpensive, easy method for quickly assessing reports of affective response in many contexts.},

On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures.},

	abstract = {A distinction is proposed betweentrust as a cognitive bias in the evaluation of incomplete information about the (potential) interaction partner andassurance as a perception of the incentive structure that leads the interaction partner to act cooperatively. It is hypothesized that trust in this sense helps people to move out of mutually committed relations where the partner's cooperation is assured. Although commitment formation is a rather standard solution to the problems caused by social uncertainty, commitment becomes a liability rather than an asset as opportunity costs increase. Facing increasing opportunity costs, trust provides a springboard in the attempt to break psychological inertia that has been mobilized to maintain committed relations. In conjunction with an assumption that networks of mutually committed relations play a more prominent role in Japanese society than in American society, this hypothesis has been applied to predict a set of cross-national differences between the United States and Japan in the levels of trust and related factors. The results of a cross-national questionnaire survey (with 1,136 Japanese and 501 American respondents) support most of the predictions, and indicate that, in comparison to Japanese respondents, American respondents are more trusting of other people in general, consider reputation more important, and consider themselves more honest and fair. In contrast, Japanese respondents see more utility in dealing with others through personal relations.},

It is unidimensional, reliable, relatively free from response biases, and purposely designed to be consistent with conceptualizations of trust from various perspectives. Dyadic trust proved to be associated with love and with intimacy of self-disclosure, especially for longer married partners. It varied by level of commitment, being lowest for ex-partners and highest for those engaged and living together, for newlyweds, and for those married over 20 years. Partners reciprocated trust more than either love or depth of self-disclosure. Future research could fruitfully relate dyadic trust to such issues as personal growth in relationships, resolving interpersonal conflict, and developing close relationships subsequent to separation or divorce.},

Competence and autonomy perceptions are also related to the intuitive nature of game controls, and the sense of presence or immersion in participants’ game play experiences. Study 4 surveys an on-line community with experience in multi-player games. Results show that SDT’s theorized needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness independently predict enjoyment and future game play. The SDT model is also compared with Yee’s (2005) motivation taxonomy of game play motivations.

	abstract = {In order to explore the benefits of communication in complex settings such as work and home environments, it is important to have a firm understanding of how communication operates in a relatively controllable system, such as video games. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of nonverbal communication on success during collaborative gameplay using both qualitative observations of and quantitative gameplay data from players of the custom-designed application TeamWyrm. In so doing, it encourages a discussion of nonverbal communication's role in gameplay, the forms of nonverbal communication displayed during gameplay, and how the availability of nonverbal communication affects player performance.},

	title = {Measuring the experience of digital game enjoyment},
	abstract = {The area of digital games constitutes a tremendously varied set of applications, with a wide range of associated player experiences, defying a one-size-fits-all approach to its conceptualization and measurement. One of the main challenges facing the gaming research community is a lack of a coherent and fine-grained set of methods and tools that enable the measurement of entertainment experiences in a sensitive, reliable and valid manner. Much like the six wise (but blind) men touching the elephant, no single methodological perspective can be said to provide a comprehensive understanding of digital gaming. Following this insight, the FUGA project, funded under the EU FP6 NEST 'Measuring the Impossible' initiative, takes a critical view towards the exclusive reliance on any one single indicator for measuring player experience. In the FUGA project, we explicitly strive towards a multi-method, multi- measure approach whereby we anchor and cross-validate various measures (e.g., self-report, psychophysiological, behavioural, neural) via their simultaneous application to a certain standardized set of games, and correlating the results thus obtained. Assessing the basic psychometric properties (sensitivity, reliability, validity) of all measures developed in the project is one of the defining characteristics of FUGA.},

I believe this approach will clarify and enhance the iterative process for developers, academics, and researchers alike, making it easier for all parties to decompose, study, and design various game designs and game artifacts.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a study to assess the influence of a variety of factors on reported level of presence in immersive virtual environments. It introduces the idea of “stacking depth,” that is, where a participant can simulate the process of entering the virtual environment while already in such an environment, which can be repeated to several levels of depth. An experimental study including 24 subjects was carried out. Half of the subjects were transported between environments by using virtual head-mounted displays, and the other half by going through doors. Three other binary factors were whether or not gravity operated, whether or not the subject experienced a virtual precipice, and whether or not the subject was followed around by a virtual actor. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic representation systems and egocentric/exocentric perceptual positions were assessed by a preexperiment questionnaire. Presence was assessed by the subjects as their sense
of “being there,” the extent to which they experienced the virtual environments as more the presenting reality than the real world in which the experiment was taking place, and the extent to which the subject experienced the virtual environments as places visited rather than images seen. A logistic regression analysis revealed that subjective reporting of presence was significantly positively associated with visual and kinesthetic representation systems, and negatively with the auditory system. This was not surprising since the virtual reality system used was primarily visual. The analysis also showed a significant and positive association with stacking level depth for those who were transported between environments by using the virtual HMD, and a negative association for those who were transported through doors. Finally, four of the subjects moved their real left arm to match movement of the left arm of the virtual body displayed by the system. These
four scored significantly higher on the kinesthetic representation system than the remainder of the subjects.},

For this exploration, we created a game design that actively utilizes a physical environment and the asymmetry between players wearing and not wearing an HMD. We implemented the designed game and conducted a user study (n=14) to evaluate the game using the Game Experience Questionnaire and an our own questionnaire. The results revealed that the players had a highly positive affect toward the game and showed a high social presence. We also obtained insights into how to make the game more interesting and to increase social presence of players.},

Yet in recent theorising about digital game experience, the social richness of playing is often marginalised or neglected all together. We argue that, although not previously recognized or defined as such, digital gaming technology can usefully be regarded as social presence technology, as it provides a setting for interacting with others at a distance and augments communication in co-located settings. In the service of future investigations of game experience, and gaming as a social experience in particular, we developed a self-report measure, the Social Presence in Gaming Questionnaire (SPGQ), based on focus group interviews with both casual and avid gamers and a social presence scale developed for other social presence devices – the Networked Minds Measure of Social Presence [40].

	abstract = {Accurate measurement of the player experience in videogames is key to understanding the impacts of videogame play, designing and developing engaging videogames, and effectively applying game design principles in other fields. A large number of player experience questionnaires are available, but in most cases empirical validation of the scales is limited or absent. Two of the most commonly used scales are the Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (PENS) and the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Both scales were developed using a rational-theoretical approach, but neither scale has had formal factor-analytic studies published, limiting our capacity to judge the empirical validity of the scales. We present detailed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of both scales based on responses from a sample (n = 571) of videogame players. The GEQ is partially supported (using a revised factor structure); the PENS is largely supported (with a more minor revision of the factor structure). We provide suggestions for the most effective use of both scales in future research.},

Understanding users’ motivation to engage and enjoy immersive VR exercise platforms is thus important to designers. We designed a VR exercise platform and conducted an experiment with two conditions, one with a static User Interface (UI) and the other with an Open World environment. Across participants there was significantly (p= .03*) greater enjoyment reported in an Open World compared to static UI. Enjoyment in both static UI and Open World conditions was positively correlated with user’s psychological needs and experience; autonomy and immersion. Participants’ future play intention was also predicted by autonomy and immersion, but only within the open world condition. Our findings also suggest players can be classified into entertainment-focused and exercise-focused with different expectations and therefore different engagement behaviours with each VR exercise environment. The study highlights the value of informing VR design with measures of psychological need satisfaction.},

To fill this gap, the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ) was developed using both classical and Rasch analyses. In Study 1 Rasch analyses provide support for the reliability and functionality of the GEQ scores. Rasch analyses also demonstrate that the GEQ has adequate separation, fit, rating scale functioning, and dimensionality, suggesting that one’s tendency to become engaged in video game-playing is a quantifiable construct. In Study 2, behavioral and questionnaire data supported the reliability and validity of the GEQ for predicting engagement in violent video games. The GEQ provides a psychometrically strong measure of levels of engagement specifically elicited while playing video games, and thus shows promise for future research examining risk and protective factors for negative game impact.},

The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants’ eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.},

We present an exploratory study where ten caregiving dyads played cooperative motion-based video games, and follow up with two case studies to analyze how video game play affects older adults and family caregivers. Our results show that playing games generally represents an enjoyable activity for older adults and caregivers that can be integrated into the caregiving context.

Other evidence, such as that concerning satiation, substitution, and behavioral consequences, is likewise consistent with the hypothesized motivation.

In our study, we have analyzed different types of cooperation between players in casual games. Each of these is based on a certain cooperative game design pattern, and can be classified as either closely- or loosely-coupled. Six game patterns have been selected and an equal number of games developed, each targeting one pattern. By means of a user experiment we have investigated which cooperation types fit most of the criteria that define casual games. More specifically, we have focused on the applicability of close coupling between players. Based on the games used in the experiment, most patterns with closely-coupled interaction have shown an overall higher user evaluation than loosely-coupled, satisfying criteria of casual games. These results indicate that introducing close coupling in the casual games under consideration is a potential way to increase the player experience.},

There is an abundance of reasons why a person will choose to utilise the conversational frameworks available, however, when considering a game where players must work together in order to reach a common goal, it is up for interpretation to determine which method works most efficiently. The aim of this work is to address this need through a game that utilises these three methods of communication in order to determine their efficiency. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was employed to formulate a well-rounded conclusion. Results indicated that a combination of voice and predetermined commands is the most efficient method of in-game communication in online, task-oriented games.},

The underlying architecture plays an important role in meeting these conditions. Peer-to-peer architectures, due to their distributed and collaborative nature, have low infrastructure costs and can achieve high scalability. They can also achieve fast response times by creating direct connections between players. However, these architectures face many challenges. Distributing a game among peers makes maintaining control over the game more complex. Peer-to-peer architectures also tend to be vulnerable to churn and cheating. Moreover, different genres of games have different requirements that should be met by the underlying architecture, rendering the task of designing a general-purpose architecture harder. Many peer-to-peer gaming solutions have been proposed that utilize a range of techniques while using somewhat different and confusing terminologies.

We evaluate its impact on task performance, immersion, and collaborative interaction. Our solution targets scenarios like live presentations or multi-user collaborative systems, where it is not convenient to develop a VR multiplayer experience and supply each user (and spectator) with an HMD. The spectator views the virtual world on a large-scale tiled video wall and is given the ability to control the orientation of their own virtual camera. This allows spectators to stay focused on the immersed user's point of view or freely look around the environment. To improve collaboration between users, we implemented a pointing system where a spectator can point at objects on the screen, which maps an indicator directly onto the objects in the virtual world. We conducted a user study to investigate the influence of rotational camera decoupling and pointing gestures in the context of HMD-immersed and non-immersed users utilizing a large-scale display. Our results indicate that camera decoupling and pointing positively impacts collaboration. A decoupled view is preferable in situations where both users need to indicate objects of interest in the scene, such as presentations and joint-task scenarios, as it requires a shared reference space. A coupled view, on the other hand, is preferable in synchronous interactions such as remote-assistant scenarios.},

Existing efforts have focused mainly on the symmetric use of technology, which excludes a rising form of interaction known as asymmetric VR, in which co-located participants use different interfaces to interact with a shared environment. There must be a clear path to creating asymmetric VR systems that are rooted in previous work from several fields, as these systems have use cases in education, hybrid reality teams (using VR and other technologies to interact online and face to face), accessibility, as well as entertainment. Currently, there is no systematic way to characterize 1) how a system may be asymmetric, 2) how the different mediation technology and affordances within asymmetric VR support (or do not support) users' goals, and 3) the relationships and collaborative capabilities between users of these different technologies. In this paper, the authors use a scoping review to explore relevant conceptual frameworks for asymmetric interaction, mediation technology, and computer supported cooperative work to clarify the dimensions of asymmetry and synthesize the literature into a Composite framework for Asymmetric VR (CAVR). The paper concludes with suggestions of ways to test and expand the framework in order to guide future research as it identifies the most-beneficial interaction paradigms for co-located asymmetric VR.},

The first challenge is the inherent power imbalance between collocated HMD wearers and non-wearers, where non-wearers cannot see what HMD wearers see. The second challenge is the inherent asymmetry of MR experiences between collocated HMD wearers, where each HMD wearer can only see their MR digital objects privately, perceiving their own version of reality. How can we leverage the imbalances and asymmetry of the MR medium into game elements for a unique gaming experience? This demonstration introduces "MOFA The Ghost", an asymmetrical inter-bodily mixed reality social exertion game inspired by the cinematic classic, Ghostbusters. Based on spontaneous collocated mixed reality technology, the design of "MOFA The Ghost" engages across three dimensions of asymmetry: device asymmetry, by integrating the game interaction utilizing device imbalance power dynamics, MR HMDs and Handheld Augmented Reality (HAR); gameplay asymmetry, through unique roles like the Ghost Controller, Detector, and Ghostbuster, each with specific objectives and limitations; and information asymmetry, fostering a specific limited visual perception with an augmented audiovisual layer for specific roles. Thanks to asymmetry of MR medium, this game encourages all collocated players to be socially competitive and cooperative at the same time. This game illuminates the potential for new design paradigms within spontaneous collocated mixed reality gaming.},

Specifically, the roles include: a HAR player as a third-person passive participant (termed spectator), a third-person active participant (termed puppeteer), a first-person participant, and a first-person partial-information participant; and a StAR player as a first-person participant and a first-person partial-information participant. In order to explore this concept, we designed four multiplayer MR game prototypes: The Duck, The Ghost, The Dragon, and The Duel to demonstrate strategies for creating interesting, engaging, and strategic cooperative experiences between players.},

With the freedom and flexibility to choose the most suitable device, we allow for inclusive environments where even spectators can be involved. However, existing research has mostly been conducted in controlled laboratory settings, which limits the applicability of the findings to naturalistic scenarios. We conducted a mixed methods study with social XR experts to explore situated and asymmetrical modalities in the context of XR gaming for enabling social interactions in naturalistic social settings, focusing on two games. We considered variations in available devices, spatial constraints, and users’ motivations and expertise. Our research suggests that asymmetrical interfaces may reduce barriers to entry for XR, support social connection, and promote cross-platform communication and collaboration. Together, our findings provoke critical discussions for future work on the effective deployment of asymmetrical interfaces in naturalistic scenarios and address potential technical, spatial, and social challenges.},

But maintaining a strong level of interaction between different player roles poses a challenge, which is exacerbated in competitive games. This paper seeks to find solutions to this problem in the context of RaceTrap, a competitive asymmetric racing game. RaceTrap combines card-playing and racing elements, where one player uses cards to create obstacles and the other tries to avoid these obstacles while driving in Virtual Reality. We address the central challenge of coupling, or maintaining a high level of awareness and interaction between the roles. The paper reviews existing approaches to coupling in asymmetric cooperative games, and highlights the needs for an improved coupling in competitive asymmetric games. We present features implemented in RaceTrap to improve coupling. These solutions highlight the importance of coupling in the emerging field of asymmetric games.},

Under constrained bitrate conditions, player actions delayed on the client add additional latency, so network game developers need tools to help prioritize the sending of player actions. This paper presents a taxonomy for player actions with latency in network games, where player actions are defined by their precision, deadline \&amp; impact. The effects of latency along each dimension of the taxonomy are analyzed through extensive experiments with a custom 2d game. Efficacy of the taxonomy in game development is illustrated by experiments that show improved player performance when prioritizing player actions based on their expected impact derived from the taxonomy dimensions.},

We created two versions: embodied controls, which use players' physiological signals (breath rate, facial expressions), and standard keyboard controls. Results from a study with 35 dyads indicate that ITSB fostered affiliation, and while embodied controls were less intuitive, people enjoyed them more. Further, photos of the dyads were rated as happier and closer in the embodied condition, indicating the potential of embodied controls to foster social closeness in synchronized play over a distance.},

We contribute our classification and analysis of 622 elicited gestures (showing more collaborative gestures in the mid-air modality), resulting in a consensus gesture set, and agreement rates showing higher consensus for touch gestures. Furthermore, we identified interaction patterns – such as benefits of situational awareness, social etiquette, gestures fostering interaction between players, and roles of gestures providing fun, excitement, and suspense to the game – which can inform future games and gesture design.},

We demonstrate this concept through the implementation of a virtual snowball fight where players can choose from multiple roles, namely the shooter, the target, or an onlooker depending on whether the game is played remotely or together in one large space. In the co-located version, the target stands behind an actuated cardboard fort that responds to events in VR, providing non-VR spectators a way to participate in the experience. During preliminary deployment, users showed extremely positive reactions and the spectators were thrilled.},

We first asked a game level designer to create playable game level chunks. Then, two artificial intelligence (AI) virtual agents driven by behavior trees played each game level chunk. We recorded the degree of collaboration required to accomplish each game level chunk by the AI virtual agents and used it to characterize each game level chunk. To synthesize a game level, we assigned to the total cost function cost terms that encode both the degree of collaboration and game level design decisions. Then, we used a Markov-chain Monte Carlo optimization method, called simulated annealing, to solve the total cost function and proposed a design for a game level. We synthesized three game levels (low, medium, and high degrees of collaboration game levels) to evaluate our implementation. We then recruited groups of participants to play the game levels to explore whether they would experience a certain degree of collaboration and validate whether the AI virtual agents provided sufficient data that described the collaborative behavior of players in each game level chunk. By collecting both in-game objective measurements and self-reported subjective ratings, we found that the three game levels indeed impacted the collaboration gameplay behavior of our participants. Moreover, by analyzing our collected data, we found moderate and strong correlations between the participants and the AI virtual agents. These results show that game developers can consider AI virtual agents as an alternative method for evaluating the degree of collaboration required to finish a game level.},

	abstract = {Collaborative games, played across multiple co-located mobile devices are gaining popularity because of their location flexibility, low hardware requirements, players’ close proximity, and their promise of generating excitement and collaborative social experience. Even though the integration of spatial device rearrangement (i.e., physically picking up a device and positioning it in another location) in cross-device applications in other domains has demonstrated higher potential for collaboration, this form of interaction remains relatively unexplored in ad hoc cross-device gaming applications. That is because these interactions typically require additional hardware support, which can hinder the ad hoc nature of the cross-device social games. In this paper, we present the iterative user-centred design process of creating an ad hoc co-located cross-device maze exploration game named Snap-To-Eat that supports both on-screen cross-device interactions (e.g., moving elements across devices) and spatial device rearrangement interactions without requiring any additional hardware. We refined the game design by conducting two rounds of workshops, the first with a low-fidelity paper prototype and the second with a high-fidelity digital prototype, with 36 undergraduate and graduate students in total. Findings from both workshops demonstrated that integrating spatial device rearrangement interactions in an ad hoc co-located cross-device game created opportunities for collaboration and engagement among the players, which elevated their overall social experience. These findings also suggested new design opportunities and future research directions for ad hoc collocated cross-device games, e.g., introducing new interactions, as well as exploring the game mechanics in a 3D space to elevate the gaming experience.},

	abstract = {In multiplayer games, players need to coordinate action to succeed. This paper investigates the effect of cognitive styles on performance of dyads engaged in collaborative gaming activities. 24 individuals took part in a mixed methods user-study; they were classified as field dependent (FD) or independent (FI) based on a cognitive style elicitation instrument. Three groups of teams were formed, based on the cognitive style of each team member: FD-FD, FD-FI, FI-FI. We examined performance in terms of game completion time, cognitive load, and player experience. The analysis revealed that FD-FI cognitive style had an effect on the performance and the mental load. We expect the findings to provide useful insight for practitioners and researchers on improving team collaboration in different contexts, such as learning, eSports, and disaster response.},

While design paradigms usually arise from gold standards that are set by previously successful games in the industry, the impact of such paradigms is under-researched for games that serve as scientific instruments, e.g., to research social behavior. Intending to investigate how such games should be designed, we built two multiplayer clients with the same game logic, one using a first-person point of view, while the other includes a top-down camera perspective. Then, we conducted an online user study in which players tested these game clients in extensive multiplayer sessions. Analyzing speech time, in-game logs, questionnaires, and qualitative feedback, we look at the perspectives’ impact on player behavior, engagement, and game experience in a scientific or "serious games" context. In addition, we have made our designed game UNISON and both clients available as open source to facilitate future empirical social science research.},

Our proposal was evaluated by a group of 34 high school students and the results revealed increased empathy and prosocial behavior in the participants. The preliminary results are promising and are a motive for the future construction of gamified environments to promote empathy in terms of prosocial behavior in children and teenagers.},

Previous work shows this enhances player experience (PX). Until now, it remains unclear whether and how an asymmetric game design with interdependences creates comparably enjoyable PX for both an HMD and a non-HMD player. In this work, we designed and implemented an asymmetric VR game (different in its user interface) with two types of interdependence: strategic (difference in game information/player capability) and biometric (difference in player’s biometric influence). Our mixed-methods user study (N=30) shows that asymmetries positively impact PX for both player roles, that interdependence strongly affects players’ perception of agency, and that biometric feedback—while subjective—is a valuable game mechanic.},

	abstract = {Mobile augmented reality (AR) has been widely used in smart and mobile device-based applications such as entertainment, games, visual experience, and information visualization. However, most of the mobile AR applications have limitations in natural user interaction and do not fully support the direct manipulation of 3D AR objects. This paper proposes a new method for naturally and directly manipulating 3D AR objects through touch and hand gesture-based interactions in handheld devices. The touch gesture is used for the AR object selection and the natural hand gesture is used for the direct and interactive manipulation of the selected objects. Thus, the hybrid interaction makes the user more accurately interact with and manipulate AR objects in the real 3D space, not in the 2D space. In particular, natural hand gestures are detected by the Leap Motion sensor attached to the front or back of mobile devices. Thus the user can easily interacts with 3D AR objects for 3D transformation to enhance usability and usefulness. In this research, comprehensive comparative analyses were performed among the proposed approach and the widely used screen touch-based approach and vision-based approach in terms of quantitative and qualitative aspects. Quantitative analysis was conducted by measuring task completion time and failure rate to perform given tasks such as 3D object matching and grasp-hang-release operation. Both tasks require simultaneous 3D translation and 3D rotation. In addition, we have compared the gesture performance depending on whether the gesture sensor is located in the front or the back of the mobile device. Furthermore, to support other complex operations, an assembly task has also been evaluated. The assembly task consists of a sequence of combining parts into a sub-assembly. Qualitative analysis was performed through enquiring questionnaire after the experiment that examines factors such as ease-of-use, ease-of-natural interaction, etc. Both analyses showed that the proposed approach can provide more natural and intuitive interaction and manipulation of mobile AR objects. Several implementation results will also be given to show the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The technical improvements in the hardware of smartphones, tablets, and smart-glasses provide an advantage for the wide use of mobile AR in the real world and experience these AR applications anywhere. However, the mobile nature of MAR applications can limit users’ interaction capabilities, such as input and haptic feedback. In this survey, we analyze current research issues in the area of human-computer interaction for haptic technologies in MAR scenarios. The survey first presents human sensing capabilities and their applicability in AR applications. We classify haptic devices into two groups according to the triggered sense: cutaneous/tactile: touch, active surfaces, and mid-air; kinesthetic: manipulandum, grasp, and exoskeleton. Due to MAR applications’ mobile capabilities, we mainly focus our study on wearable haptic devices for each category and their AR possibilities. To conclude, we discuss the future paths that haptic feedback should follow for MAR applications and their challenges.},

Most of these studies have utilized AR paddles or AR cubes for interactions. However, these interactions overly constrain the users in their ability to directly manipulate AR objects and are limited in providing natural feeling in the user interface. This paper presents a novel approach to natural and intuitive interactions through a direct hand touchable interface in various AR-based user experiences. It combines markerless augmented reality with a depth camera to effectively detect multiple hand touches in an AR space. Furthermore, to simplify hand touch recognition, the point cloud generated by Kinect is analyzed and filtered out. The proposed approach can easily trigger AR interactions, and allows users to experience more intuitive and natural sensations and provides much control efficiency in diverse AR environments. Furthermore, it can easily solve the occlusion problem of the hand and arm region inherent in conventional AR approaches through the analysis of the extracted point cloud. We present the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach by demonstrating several implementation results such as interactive AR car design and touchable AR pamphlet. We also present an analysis of a usability study to compare the proposed approach with other well-known AR interactions.},
